The OGC's Role in Geosciences and the Environment

Table of Contents:

Overview

Earth systems are coupled, and therefore discovering and sharing geospatial data and processing resources across disciplines is critical for those working in geosciences and the environment. Unfortunately, professionals seeking to understand and sustainably manage water, waste, energy, pollution, forests, croplands, oceans and climate find that data and processing "stovepipes" of various kinds often make such discovery and access difficult, even within a discipline.

In the OGC, universities, research organizations, NGOs, companies and government organizations work together in OGC Standards Working Groups and Domain Working Groups (such as Earth Systems Science, Hydrology, Metadata, Meteorology & Oceanography, Sensor Web Enablement) to remove technical obstacles to institutional information sharing. Often the work takes place in fast-paced interoperability experiments, testbeds and pilot projects. The benefits of this collaborative effort extend beyond data sharing to the enablement of previously unachievable data-intensive science and chained models of coupled Earth phenomena.

OGC standards for Geosciences and the Environment

Top

As the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says in its introduction to the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), "...while there are thousands of moored and free floating data buoys in the world's oceans, thousands of land-based environmental stations, and over 50 environmental satellites orbiting the globe, all providing millions of data sets, most of these technologies do not yet talk to each other." Even though many of these data sets are coordinated globally through existing global institutions, the constraints of efficiency, cost, timeliness and safety criticality have militated against wider exchanges that are now becoming expected.

In the OGC, environmental and natural resource researchers and managers work together with geospatial technology providers to develop standards and best practices that enable diverse systems to "talk to each other." Through OGC membership, government organizations, research organizations and software vendors engage in efficient fact-finding, planning and partnering. They then develop standards that expand both the capabilities of technology users and the business opportunities for technology providers. As the market for interoperable geoprocessing technologies expands, technology providers are able to offer increasingly more effective, varied and affordable tools for users. As standards-based products and best practices become widely used, opportunities are created for researchers to access and share more scientific data. Indeed, the growing ability of networked resources to communicate with each other has created the necessary conditions for a dramatic increase in the productivity and capability of researchers and educators working in Earth system science, and these benefits will extend to environmental managers.

OGC Geoscience and Environment Domain Working Groups

Top

More than 25 OGC Technical Committee Domain Working Groups (DWGs) have formed to address interoperability in particular technology and application domains. The DWGs that are most directly related to geosciences and the environment include: Catalog, Data Preservation, Data Quality, Earth Systems Science, Emergency & Disaster Management, Hydrology, Metadata, Meteorology & Oceanography, Sensor Web Enablement and University.

The OGC Hydrology DWG exemplifies the ways in which geoscience and environment communities can take advantage of the OGC’s comprehensive international standards development and maintenance capabilities, technical expertise and community networking and outreach. The members of the Hydrology DWG, a joint working group of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the OGC, have created the OGC WaterML 2.0 standard. This effort has been led by an Australian government organization, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), working in close collaboration with the US Consortium for the Advancement of Hydrological Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI) and other organizations. The ultimate goal is to improve the overall availability of water data and the interoperability of water information systems for hydrologic research and water resource management.

Other application communities, building on their earlier data coordination efforts, have also developed community-specific OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) application schemas (AIXM for aviation, GeoSciML for geosciences, etc.), and often this work is done in OGC working groups and OGC testbeds and interoperability experiments.

Geosciences and the Environment in the OGC Interoperability Program

 Top

OGC testbeds, pilot projects and interoperability experiments are part of the OGC Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver proven candidate specifications into OGC Standards Program, where they are formalized for public release.

The WaterML 2.0 specification, for example, was refined through OGC Ground Water and Surface Water Interoperability Experiments with volunteer participation from several key water agencies, companies and research groups from around the world. This work culminated in the creation of the WaterML 2.0 Standards Working Group (SWG), which is working on a few remaining details to advance the candidate WaterML 2.0 standard to become an international adopted OGC standard.

GEOSS, mentioned above, is an international program to achieve comprehensive, coordinated and sustained observations of the Earth system, in order to improve monitoring of the state of the Earth, increase understanding of Earth processes, and enhance prediction of the behavior of the Earth system. The OGC is involved in GEOSS in several ways. The OGC plays the lead role for the multi-year GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP) and helps to organize the multi-year series of workshops that test and demonstrate interoperability in the various GEOSS societal benefit areas.

Other OGC Interoperability Initiatives related to the geosciences and environment include:

- OGC Water Information Services Concept Development
- Climate Challenge Integration Plugfest
- GALEON Interoperability Experiment
- Ocean Science Interoperability Experiment II
- Earth Observation and ENVironmental modelling for the mitigation of HEAlth risks (EO2HEAVEN)
- Kentucky Watershed Modeling Information Portal

The OGC's Alliance Partnerships

Top

The OGC maintains alliance partnerships with many standards development organizations and industry associations to ensure that OGC standards work well with other standards and to ensure that OGC standards meet user requirements across a broad spectrum of domains and applications. OGC Alliance Partners involved in the geosciences and environment include, for example:

- Association of Geographic Information Laboratories in Europe (AGILE)
- Foundation for Earth Science
- IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS)
- IEEE Technical Committee 9 (Sensor Web)
- ISO IEC JTC 1/SC 24/WG 8 - Computer graphics, image processing and environmental presentation
- Taxonomic Data Working Group (TDWG)
- University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) / National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
- World Meteorological Organization (WMO)

Research advantages accruing from OGC standards efforts

Top

Most scientific and professional disciplines that use Earth Observation (EO) systems, geographic information systems (GIS) and other geospatial technologies have special requirements that determine their data models and usual processing methods. Individual scientists, focused on their research problems, often develop even more specialized data models and methods. The industry legacy of non-interoperable proprietary geoprocessing systems has contributed to the lack of data sharing, but now vendor implementations of open interface and encoding standards have largely removed this obstacle.

Scientific research, particularly interdisciplinary research involving human impacts on the natural environment, depends on access to lots of data, data that is often expensive to develop or acquire.  Data sharing is the obvious solution, but researchers often have difficulty discovering what data are available and overcoming technical and institutional obstacles to accessing and using the data. Not only research, but also environmental policy and public outreach could benefit greatly from improved data sharing.

The technical interoperability framework that is being developed for GEOSS is based on a set of open standards and best practices that are available to the international geoscience community. These are rapidly gaining importance in domains such as ocean observation, meteorology and hydrology.  As the technical barriers to data sharing fall away, so will the institutional obstacles, as is evident in initiatives such as the US National Science Foundation's Earth Cube effort.

Much of the university research that takes place in the OGC community involves advancing the capabilities of processing resources used by scientists and environmental practitioners. Standards are essential for the advancement of sensor webs, chained environmental models, semantic processing and management of data rights, provenance and quality, among other topics. See the description of activity in the University and Research domain [LINK] for more information about this research.

Advancing the data sharing platform

Environmental and natural resource researchers and managers work together with geospatial technology providers in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to develop standards that enable diverse systems to talk to each other. Through OGC membership, agencies, universities, research organizations and companies have the opportunity to both participate in this progress and to engage in efficient fact-finding, planning and partnering. The standards expand both the capabilities of technology users and the business opportunities for technology providers. As the market for interoperable geoprocessing technologies expands, technology providers are able to offer increasingly more effective, varied and affordable tools for users. As standards-based products become widely used, researchers can more easily use data and models developed in neighboring domains.

Features of OGC Participation

Top

OGC members

- Help shape standards to publish, discover, assess and access data and services via the Web
- Improve interoperability among specialized scientific systems to enable, for example, the chaining of climate model components
- Improve data sharing between information communities, which adds value to the data by making it more subject to review and more useful in more studies
- Support global scientific and management cooperation, for better return on investment in data gathering and more rapid scientific progress
- Gain insight into trends, requirements and products
- Help scientists, environmental managers, disaster managers and the public communicate

- Improve rigor and consistency in geoprocessing, sampling strategies, remote sensing, spatial accuracy assessment, and longitudinal studies
- Advance Geospatial Digital Rights Management standards to support a range of policies and business models.

The work in the OGC recognizes the growing importance of Service Oriented Architectures. Current Internet technologies have been adapted in the OGC’s consensus process to provide OGC interface and encoding standards that enable technology providers and users to overcome the non-interoperability of geospatial systems. The standards make it much easier to publish, discover, and access not only geospatial data but also geospatial data schemas and online geoprocessing services. OGC standards specify service interfaces and encodings matched to those service interfaces. Developers of proprietary and open source software implement these in their products and solutions to make their products and services part of a larger open network of such resources.

OGC standards include, for example: OGC Catalogue Services - Web, Coordinate Transformation, XML-based Geography Markup Language (GML), GML in JPEG 2000, Grid Coverage Services (for gridded data), Web Feature Services (for vector data), and the Web Map Service Standard (for access to simple raster maps produced by raster or vector systems). Other standards and activities in the OGC address location services, geospatial digital rights management (GeoRM), Sensor Web Enablement (SWE), decision support service chaining, geospatial semantics, security and more.

Almost all OGC standards are based on accepted Web-based distributed computing models. The standards represent 16 years of consensus work, which means that they comprise many man years of software development and contain an extraordinary amount of expertise and know-how that are available for use by anyone who cares to build on this free and unencumbered intellectual property.

Participate in the OGC consensus process!

OGC membership provides a cost-effective way for geoscience communities and environmental management organizations to contribute to the development of 21st century scientific data collection, processing and dissemination practices. Membership also provides unique opportunities for networking among academic, NGO, government and private sector organizations. We look forward to discussing with you how you might use the OGC to advance interoperability in your professional community.

Open Initiative Homepage

What does it mean for government to be open? According to President Obama's Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government, it means fostering a culture of transparency, participation, and collaboration throughout the government. Please explore how the EPA is achieving the goals set forth by the President!

My Green Apps

EPA just launched My Green Apps, a website to help people find over 100 existing environmental apps (for smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices). The site includes apps from EPA, other agencies, and third party developers about a broad range of topics. In addition, people can tell EPA what ideas they like best by "liking" an idea for an app. Once people have prioritized the ideas, EPA can find environmental data so developers can convert the ideas into apps. My Green Apps is for people who use apps and it complements EPA'sDeveloper Central, which is for app developers.

My Green Apps is a customer-focused site that helps the public see what apps EPA is providing. It also shows the wide range of environmental apps that others have created. It is transparent in that it lists the EPA data that are used in each app. Be sure to visit Ideas for Apps, for ideas that could be converted into apps, where EPA has done some homework for developers by identifying EPA data that could be used to create the apps. Check out the site and spread the word!

FFSEP OpenGov

EPA is announcing the release of its Federal Facilities Site Evaluation Project (FFSEP) website. The FFSEP is a culmination of efforts undertaken in 2010 under the Integrated Cleanup Initiative (ICI) to determine the disposition of sites that appeared to be making insufficient, if any, cleanup progress. The FFSEP evaluated 514 federally owned sites that were identified in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS) as potentially stalled in their progress when the ICI was begun in FY2010.

In an effort to verify the activity description and status of the 514 FFSEP sites, EPA reached out to the Federal Departments and Agencies with sites on the list. We collaborated with our Federal partners to gather the most current information available on these sites. We engaged our state partners to include site information from their records. This collaboration enabled EPA to make activity determinations on 491 of the 514 sites that had not been fully assessed. The cooperation offered by the other Federal Agencies and our state partners was invaluable to the success of this project. The FFSEP supports EPA’s commitment to open government by providing access to information about these sites, so that the public can more fully engage in cleanups in their communities.

European protected sites

28 May 2013

The map shows an overview of protected sites in Europe, including Natura 2000 sites and nationally designated areas (CDDA). Natura 2000 is the key instrument to protect biodiversity in the European Union. It is an ecological network of protected areas, set up to ensure the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats. Nationally designated areas is a European inventory of protected areas designated by the national authorities. Zoom into the map to visualise the national areas.

State of bathing waters

17 May 2013

Bathing water monitoring by country. Please note: for the scales 1:5.000.001 and less detailed, data are aggregated by country. In such case, stacked bars show percentage of bathing water quality for coastal and inland waters together. Number of bathing waters within certain category is seen in pop up window which can be turned on with a click on one of the countries. For the scale range 1:5 000.000 to 1:700,001, individual bathing water sites (points) are visible instead of classified stacked charts and are coloured according to the classification of bathing water quality. Symbol size depends on the map scale (in more detailed map scales symbols are bigger). For the scales 1:700,000 and more detailed, symbol of bather in a square appears instead of points. Symbol size depends on the map scale.

Repairing our ozone layer

In 1987, delegates from around the world signed the Montreal Protocol designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion. This recent video illustrates the results of the Protocol, which is considered to be one of the most successful international environmental agreements.   More

Giving Europe more breathing space

Air pollution has been one of Europe’s main concerns since the late 1970s. Over the last few decades, the rapid growth in industry and increased reliance on cars and public transport has contributed to a rapid decline in air quality, from smog and acid rain to asthma and other respiratory diseases.

Air Pollution: harmful particles

The European Commission wants to further reduce air pollution in Europe. Although the situation has improved substantially over the last few decades, there are still significant areas of concern with regard to certain pollutants that are particularly harmful to human health (respiratory diseases) and damaging to the environment (acidification, eutrophication, etc.). The anti-pollution programme that the Commission has launched to that effect is called the “Clean Air for Europe” or CAFE programme.   More

Clean air for Europe

Air pollution is a growing concern in the area of public health. Scientific research shows that air pollutants are behind a higher number of diseases such as respiratory allergies, asthma and inflammatory conditions. It is the most vulnerable segments of populations, the elderly and children, who are the first to be affected by this phenomenon. In May 2001, the European Commission launched its " Clean Air for Europe " (CAFE) programme. This is a three-year programme intended to investigate all sources of air pollution and provide solutions to reduce them.   More

Creation of low level ozone

HOW LOW LEVEL OZONE IS CREATED Low level ozone pollution is often not given much consideration next to the depletion of the ozone layer. However, it can damage health of humans, animals, trees and plants. In high quantities it also contributes to acid rain and the green house effect, as well as being partly responsible for photo chemical smog. Car exhausts release nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. Volatile Organic Compounds are released through chemical plants and products including solvents, paints and hairspray. These two chemicals react with each other and sunlight to create ozone. In humans, ozone can cause lung tissue damage, and create high incidences of asthma and allergenic reactions. Plants exposed to high ozone concentrations lose their chlorophyll and their food manufacturing abilities.   More

Extreme weather variations with climate change

(This video has no audio.) In the past decade Europe has been affected by three remarkable weather extremes. The summers of 1995 and 2003 were extremely hot throughout most parts of Europe. In contrast, 2002 was very wet and saw extreme flooding in central Europe. Changes are also projected for the amount of rainfall in Europe, which could more pronounced flooding. Cold winters (which occurred once every 10 years from 1961 to 1990) are likely to become rare and will almost entirely disappear by 2080. In contrast, by 2080 nearly every summer in many parts of Europe is projected to be hotter than the 10 % hottest summers in the current climate. In southern Europe, these changes are projected to occur even earlier (in Spain by the 2020s) (Parry, 2000). This could have severe consequences for agriculture, water resources and the frequency of forest fires in southern Europe.

Rising snowline in the Alps

(This video has no audio.) It is estimated that, as global warming proceeds, regions currently receiving snowfall will increasingly receive precipitation in the form of rain. For every 1ºC increase in temperature, the snowline rises by about 150 metres. As a result, less snow will accumulate at low elevations. As a consequence, nearly half of all ski resorts in Switzerland, and even more in Germany, Austria and the Pyrenees, will face difficulties in attracting tourists and winter sport enthusiasts in the future.

Participating cities in Air Implementation Pilot project

Eight cities were originally selected early in 2012 to take part in the Pilot: Berlin, Dublin, Madrid, Malmö, Milan, Ploiesti, Prague, and Vienna. At the end of 2012, it was decided to expand the urban sample by inviting up to four additional cities to take part in the Pilot to ensure a reasonably representative sample. Antwerp, Paris, Plovdiv and Vilnius were invited to join the project to better reflect geographical coverage, city size, and a variety of main pollution sources. In the map below, the 12 Pilot cities are shown.   More

Global Forecast System (GFS)

An animated image of GFS simulated total atmospheric ozone concentration, forecast from 00UTC on July 12, 2012 to July 16, 2012 at 00UTC—a four day forecast—in three hourly intervals. The lowest concentrations of ozone on the planet reside over the Antarctic during this period. This image was produced with the Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) and ImageMagick.

The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration. The entire globe is covered by the GFS at a base horizontal resolution of 18 miles (28 kilometers) between grid points, which is used by the operational forecasters who predict weather out to 16 days in the future. Horizontal resolution drops to 44 miles (70 kilometers) between grid point for forecasts between one week and two weeks. The GFS model is a coupled model, composed of four separate models (an atmosphere model, an ocean model, a land/soil model, and a sea ice model), which work together to provide an accurate picture of weather conditions. Changes are regularly made to the GFS model to improve its performance and forecast accuracy. It is a constantly evolving and improving weather model. Gridded data are available for download through NOMADS. Forecast products and more information on GFS are available at the GFS homepage.

A global analysis plot of GFS surface temperatures, in degrees Celsius, for July 12, 2012 at 00UTC. At this time, the highest surface temperatures on the planet are in the Sonoran Desert in northwest Mexico and the southwestern United States. The extreme maximum temperature is 56.5°C, or 134°F. This graphic was generated by downloading a subset of GFS data through the NOMADS THREDDS Data Server (TDS) then visualizing with NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory's ferret visualization tool.

The TimesTags API

Note: This document describes version 1, which is the current version of the TimesTags API.

With the TimesTags API, you can mine the riches of the New York Times tag set. The TimesTags service matches your query to the controlled vocabularies that fuel NYTimes.com metadata. You supply a string of characters, and the service returns a ranked list of suggested terms.

Note: In this document, curly braces { } indicate required variables. Square brackets [ ] indicate optional parameters or placeholders.

THE TIMESTAGS API AT A GLANCE
Base URI

To use the TimesTags API, you must sign up for an API key. Usage is limited to 5000 requests per day (rate limits are subject to change). Please read and agree to the API Terms of Use and the Attribution Guidelines before you proceed.

Article Search API Version 2

With the Article Search API, you can search New York Times articles from Sept. 18, 1851 to today, retrieving headlines, abstracts, lead paragraphs, links to associated multimedia and other article metadata.

Note: In URI examples and field names, italics indicate placeholders for variables or values. Brackets [ ] indicate optional items. Parentheses ( ) are not a convention — when URIs include parentheses, interpret them literally.

Laws matching "health care" and "medicine"

/bills/search?query="health care" medicine&history.enacted=true

Operators allowed:

   * Wildcards: Use * as a wildcard within words (e.g. nanotech*). Cannot be used within phrases.
   * Adjacency: Append ~ and a number to a phrase to allow the words to come within X words of each other. (e.g. "transparency accountability"~5)

Bills matching "freedom of information" and words starting with "accountab"

/bills/search?query="freedom of information" accountab*

Bills with "transparency" and "accountability" within 5 words of each other

/bills/search?query="transparency accountability"~5

Highlighting

When performing full text search, you can retrieve highlighted excerpts of where your search matched by using the parameter highlight=true. (This will make the request slower, so only use if needed.)

Recent bills matching "gun control", with highlighting

/bills/search?query="gun control"&highlight=true&order=introduced_on

By default, highlighting is performed with the <em> and </em> tags. Control these tags by passing start and close tags to the highlight.tags parameter. (Disable the highlighting of search terms altogether, leaving only a plain text excerpt, by passing a lone comma, ,.)

Bills matching "immigration", with excerpts highlighted with <b> tags

/bills/search?query=immigration&highlight=true&highlight.tags=<b>,</b>

Bills matching "immigration", with excerpts with no highlighting

/bills/search?query=immigration&highlight=true&highlight.tags=,

Control the size of highlighted excerpts with the highlight.size parameter. (Note: This doesn't always work; the database makes a best attempt.) The default highlight.size is 200.

Bills matching "drugs", with larger excerpts

/bills/search?query=drugs&highlight=true&highlight.size=500

Constructing a Semantic API Request by Linked Data Reference

<concept_uri> is the numerical ID that comes at the end of the URI for concept reference pages at http://data.nytimes.com. For example:

Concept Type

Example

Reference URL

concept_uri

Person

Obama, Barack

http://data.nytimes.com/47452218948077706853

47452218948077706853

The general form for a Semantic API request by concept type and specific concept:

http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/uri/<concept_uri>.[xml|json](?optional_parameters)&api-key=your-API-key

Examples of Semantic API requests by concept type and specific concept:

Constructing a Semantic API Request by Article

The <article_uri> refers to the part of the article's Web address that comes after "http://www.nytimes.com" minus its ".html" suffix. The article_uri is a mandatory parameter for accessing the Semantic API with an article. An example of the article_uri:

Article Title

Article URL

Constructing a Search Query

The general form for Search Query consists of a query string (query=<query_term>) and optional parameters.

http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/search.[xml|json}?query=<query_term>(&optional_parameters)&api-key=your-api-key

The optional parameters for a Search Query are <concept_type>, <concept_uri>, <article_uri>. These optional parameters are derived from the other types of Semantic API requests and are explained in the instructions for constructing those requests (above).

An example of a Search Query, it asks for all of the concepts of type 'nytd_per' that contain the substring "Evan" and return the result formatted in XML.

http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/search.xml?query=evan&concept_type=nytd_per&api-key=your-api-key

Examples

These examples use an .xml extension for illustration purposes. Also, these examples do not include the required api-key parameter. Be sure to include your API key in your request.

Mark Kirk’s voting record returned in CSV format. A high limit is set so all of the results make it into the file.

Libraries/Wrappers

You might find these useful: node.js wrapper, GovTrack on Temboo.

General Options

Output Format

Results are returned in JSON by default, but you can change the result format to JSONP, XML, or CSV using the format query string parameter. For instance, add format=jsonp&callback=your_function, format=xml, or format=csv to your query string arguments. (You will need either a ? or an & to separate it from the rest of the URL or arguments, of course.)

You can also specify which fields you want using the fields argument. Use double-underscores to span relationships, such as sponsor__id for bills.

To get a list of currently serving Members of Congress in CSV format use:
http://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/role?current=true&format=csv&fields=state,district,title_long,person__firstname,person__lastname,person__name&limit=600.

Limit/Offset

Results are paged 100 per call by default. This is true even in CSV format. Set the limit parameter to a high value to get all of the results at once. Use offset to page through results.

Sort

You can sort results on a single field using the sort parameter on any sortable field (as listed below). Prepend the field name with a minus sign to sort in descending order.

To find the most recent votes:
http://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/vote?sort=-created

Filtering

You can filter output on any filterable field, as indicated in the field documentation below.

For instance, to list bills in the 112th Congress use congress=112 like so:
http://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/bill?congress=112

The bills and people APIs also support the q field which performs a full-text search:
http://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/bill?q=internet

To specify a null value, just use “null”

Besides exact comparisons, you can also use several operators as fieldname__operator. The operators are contains, exact, gt, gte, lt, lte, in, startswith, and range. To find votes this year, use:
http://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/vote?created__gt=2012-01-01T00:00:00

Dates are a little quirky at the moment. The bill and person APIs require dates to be specified in Solr’s date format which is the typical ISO format plus a Z at the end (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). The other APIs will accept a date in any format MySQL recognizes, which is usually YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS. Neither Solr or MySQL understand the format of the other, unfortunately.

The in and range operators accept multiple values separated by pipe characters. To find bills whose status is/was either signed by the president or enacted by veto override use:
http://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/bill?current_status__in=enacted_signed|enacted_veto_override

Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data

The ultimate objective of the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) is to achieve "... stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate sytem."

Estimating the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals is an important element of the efforts to achieve this objective. This web page provides access to most recent data on national GHG emissions and removals as follows:

- GHG Data - UNFCCC: this page is an entry to the UNFCCC GHG data interface which provides access to the most recent GHG data reported by countries that are Parties to the Climate Change Convention
- KP Data - UNFCCC: this is a page with GHG data relating specifically to the Kyoto Protocol; the data are as reported by Annex I Parties that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol
- GHG Data - Non-UNFCCC: this page provides links to the web sites of various organizations that also collect, estimate and/or disseminate data on GHG emissions/removals
- Online Help: the help page contains extensive explanatory information to assist the user in finding the right GHG data
- Contact: this page suggests an e-mail address that can be used to contact the UNFCCC secretariat for questions, clarifications or more information relating to GHG data

How to find the GHG data needed within the GHG data interface

The UNFCCC data interface provides a vast multitude of data. Data can be displayed for individual Parties or groups of Parties, for different greenhouse gases or for their sum, and in varying degrees of detail. To find the exact GHG data required, the user is advised to consult the following table where typical user requirements are mapped against the data availability on this site.

At the 2012 UN Climate Change Conference in Doha, Qatar (COP18/ CMP8), governments consolidated the gains of the last three years of international climate change negotiations and opened a gateway to necessary greater ambition and action on all levels. Among the many decisions taken, governments:

- Strengthened their resolve and set out a timetable to adopt a universal climate agreement by 2015, which will come into effect in 2020.

- Streamlined the negotiations, completing the work under the
Bali Action Plan to concentrate on the new work towards a 2015 agreement under a single negotiating stream in the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP).

- Emphasized the need to increase their ambition to cut greenhouse gases (GHGs) and to help vulnerable countries to adapt.

- Launched a new commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, thereby ensuring that this treaty's important legal and accounting models remain in place and underlining the principle that developed countries lead mandated action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

- Made further progress towards establishing the financial and technology support and new institutions to enable clean energy investments and sustainable growth in developing countries.

The Urgency to Act

While there has been some success in climate change mitigation, global emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise.

International action under the UNFCCC must be guided by the best available science. Increasingly frequent and progressively more severe impacts of climate change make the need for urgent action abundantly clear.

This is underscored by a growing number of reports, which have also provided options and solutions for the world to act effectively now to prevent much more serious climate change in the future. Most recent and upcoming reports include:

- The World Bank's "
Turn Down the Heat: Why a 4°C Warmer World Must Be Avoided", showing that the world is on track towards a 4 degrees Celsius temperature rise, should the currently inadequate level of ambition remain.

- UNEP's Emissions Gap Report 2012, which demonstrated that it is still possible to bridge the emissions gap by 2020.

- The World Economic Forum's
Global Risks 2013 report, released early in 2013. This report outlines a survey of more than 1000 experts polled on how they expect 50 global risks to play out over the next ten years. The report cites rising greenhouse gas emissions as one of the five major risks the global economy faces, and calls runaway climate change an X-factor that multiplies and exacerbates all risk.

- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will release its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2013 and 2014. The assessment will provide governments with the latest science on physics and impacts of climate change, and the scale of ambition necessary to successfully tackle climate change. The first installment of AR5 on the science is due this September, and the second and third installments are scheduled for release in March/April 2014. More info can be found on the IPCC website.

UNFCCC Technology work

Promoting the effective development and transfer of environmentally sound technologies is critical in enabling developing countries to pursue their objectives for sustainable development in a climate-friendly manner. The Convention therefore urges developed country Parties and Annex II Parties to take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly to developing countries, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention.

Development and transfer of technologies

Promoting and enhancing national and international cooperative action on the development and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing country Parties to the UNFCCC are critical means to support action on mitigation and adaptation now, up to and beyond 2012, in order to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention.

Technology Mechanism

The new Technology Mechanism established by the Cancun Agreements in December 2010 represents a step to move beyond the 'conventional' approach to technology transfer under the Convention in the past several years – based essentially on capacity building and technology needs assessments – to a more 'dynamic' arrangement geared towards fostering public-private partnerships; promoting innovation; catalyzing the use of technology road maps or action plans; mobilizing national, regional and international technology centres and network; and facilitating joint R&D activities. The Technology Mechanism consists of a Technology Executive Committee (TEC) and a Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN).

Technology Executive Committee

The TEC facilitates the effective implementation of the Technology Mechanism, as the policy component of the Technology Mechanism, consistent with its functions. The TEC shall also further implement the technology transfer framework, with special attention to support an important ongoing effort by developing country Parties to identify and prioritize their technology needs through the Technology Needs Assessments (TNAs) process supported under the Poznan strategic programme on technology transfer.

Climate Technology Centre and Network

The CTCN facilitates the effective implementation of the Technology Mechanism, consistent with its functions. The TEC and CTCN are accountable to and operate under the guidance of the COP.

The Technology Mechanism, once it becomes fully operational in 2012, will play a meaningful role in making a "real" difference as envisaged by the Cancun Agreements. Importantly, the Technology Mechanism must become an integrated and coherent entity which is both flexible in its design and operations and effective in carrying out its tasks to support the ultimate objective of the Convention. It would do this through accelerating international, regional and national technology development and transfer action that supports mitigation and adaptation on the ground at a scale that can make an impact on the global effort.

Technology information clearing house

The technology information clearing house (TT:CLEAR) aims to provide information in support of ongoing technology transfer activities under the Convention as well as to enhance the generation and flow of, access to, reliable technical, economic, environmental and regulatory information relating to the development and transfer of environmentally sound technologies.

Mitigation

According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC AR4), global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have grown since pre-industrial times, with an increase of 70 per cent between 1970 and 2004. With current climate change mitigation policies and related sustainable development practices, these emissions will continue to grow over the next few decades. Continue

National actions on mitigation in the context of the Bali Roadmap

Central to the Cancun Agreements adopted by Parties in 2010 is the decision to hold the increase in the global average temperature below 2 °C, or below 1.5 °C, above pre-industrial levels. In order to contribute to this goal, more than 90 Parties made conditional and unconditional pledges to reduce emissions by 2020 under the Cancun Agreements.
For developed countries, these pledges encompass quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets under the Convention for all developed countries (FCCC/SB/2011/INF.1/Rev.1) and quantified emission limitation or reduction commitments under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol by developed countries assuming commitments for this period. (

Doha Amendment (117 kB) )
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions by developing country Parties pursuant to decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 50, are compiled in document FCCC/SBI/2013/INF.12/Rev.2.

Climate finance

Climate finance refers to local, national or transnational financing, which may be drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing. Climate finance is critical to addressing climate change because large-scale investments are required to significantly reduce emissions, notably in sectors that emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. Climate finance is equally important for adaptation, for which significant financial resources will be similarly required to allow countries to adapt to the adverse effects and reduce the impacts of climate change.

The adaptation process

Adaptation refers to adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts. It refers to changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate potential damages or to benefit from opportunities associated with climate change.

Elements of adaptation

Adaptation activities span five general components: observation; assessment of climate impacts and vulnerability; planning; implementation; and monitoring and evaluation of adaptation actions.

The SNAP library is being actively developed since 2004 and is organically growing as a result of our research pursuits in analysis of large social and information networks. Largest network we analyzed so far using the library was the Microsoft Instant Messenger network from 2006 with 240 million nodes and 1.3 billion edges.

The datasets available on the website were mostly collected (scraped) for the purposes of our research.

Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection

- Social networks : online social networks, edges represent interactions between people
- Networks with ground-truth communities : ground-truth network communities in social and information networks
- Communication networks : email communication networks with edges representing communication
- Citation networks : nodes represent papers, edges represent citations
- Collaboration networks : nodes represent scientists, edges represent collaborations (co-authoring a paper)
- Web graphs : nodes represent webpages and edges are hyperlinks
- Amazon networks : nodes represent products and edges link commonly co-purchased products
- Internet networks : nodes represent computers and edges communication
- Road networks : nodes represent intersections and edges roads connecting the intersections
- Autonomous systems : graphs of the internet
- Signed networks : networks with positive and negative edges (friend/foe, trust/distrust)
- Location-based online social networks : Social networks with geographic check-ins
- Wikipedia networks and metadata : Talk, editing and voting data from Wikipedia
- Twitter and Memetracker : Memetracker phrases, links and 467 million Tweets
- Online communities : Data from online communities such as Reddit and Flickr
- Online reviews : Data from online review systems such as BeerAdvocate and Amazon

SNAP networks are also availalbe from UF Sparse Matrix collection. Visualizations of SNAP networks by Tim Davis.

Network data

This page contains links to some network data sets I've compiled over the years. All of these are free for scientific use to the best of my knowledge, meaning that the original authors have already made the data freely available, or that I have consulted the authors and received permission to the post the data here, or that the data are mine. If you make use of any of these data, please cite the original sources.

The data sets are in GML format. For a description of GML see here. GML can be read by many network analysis packages, including Gephi and Cytoscape. I've written a simple parser in C that will read the files into a data structure. It's available here. There are many features of GML not supported by this parser, but it will read the files in this repository just fine. There is a Python parser for GML available as part of the NetworkX package here and another in the igraph package, which can be used from C, Python, or R.

Free Sources of Geospatial Raster Data

« Die Geojobs der Woche – KW 04 2013 more articles Le Geocodage d’adresses à partir de Quantum Gis »

I’m always looking for good sources of free data, so I thought I would post a few here in case they were useful to others. The sources listed below tend to be larger providers of regional to global level data, however, please post suggestions in the comments if there are other sources you like and think should be added. I had initially planned to include vector data here, but I think that will be another post as this one got quite long.

SAR Data

Free Synthetic Aperture Radar data can be some of the hardest to find, but it is out there if you look hard enough. These products are often provided in CEOS or other formats and there are a variety of tools available for working with the data. Some of the more common tools are ASF MapReady, The Next ESA SAR Toolbox, and PolSARPro. Each of these supports certain datasets and not others. NEST also supports interferometry for the ESA-provided SAR data sets through an interface to the DORIS package from Delft University.

UAVSAR

This one is pretty close to home for me. The Alaska Satellite Facility at the University of Alaska Fairbanks is the distributor of data from NASA’s UAVSAR mission. This airborne platform is fully polarimetric and also offers a repeat-pass interferometry product. These products are available free of charge to all users.

Links:
UAVSAR Website at JPL
Search UAVSAR data at ASF

PALSAR Mosaics

These products were generated as part of JAXA’s Kyoto and Carbon project and come in two forms, a 50m orthorectified mosaic and 500m browse mosaics. They are derived from dual-polarization PALSAR and may be useful for forest mapping and regional studies, particularly in the tropics.

Links:
JAXA Kyoto and Carbon Mosaics

ERS/Envisat @ ESA

ERS-1/-2 and Envisat were launched and operated by ESA and supported a wide variety of applications during their lifetimes. For commercial purposes, the products are available from a variety of resellers, however, if you are a researcher you can get access to data at no cost. It does require you to submit a small proposal to ESA for access to data, but the process is relatively simple and ESA’s user support is very helpful if you have problems.

Links:
ESA PI Portal

Optical Data

There are many resources available for free or public domain optical data. In the U.S., the best of these are the USGS and NASA. Both offer vast archives of data, generally at no cost to the user.

EROS Data Center

EROS Data Center (EDC) is the primary data center operated by the USGS. It houses an enormous archive of everything from high-resolution optical imagery to the complete archive of Landsat imagery. Their archive is global in nature and free to the public, however, you will need to create an account (free) to download data. Their search and download client, EarthExplorer, is easy to use and the best way to find data at the USGS is just get on EarthExplorer and start working through the many data sources available. No one knows for sure when Landsat 8 data will be available in EarthExplorer, but hopefully this summer we will start seeing this exciting new dataset.

Link:
USGS EarthExplorer

Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF)

GLCF is a great site for land cover data, primarily Landsat data. However, they also host DEM data from SRTM and isolated other data sets. If you are a Landsat user, this is definitely a place to bookmark.

Link:
GLCF at University of Maryland

Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)

GCMD is not itself a provider of geospatial data, but they act as a metadata clearinghouse for many data providers around the world. You won’t get access to data at GCMD, but you can find who provides access to the data.

Links:
Global Change Master Directory

MODIS @ NASA

The MODIS sensors, on NASA’s Aqua and Terra spacecraft, have been collected ocean and land surface data for over 10 years. While the pixels are large (250m), the swath is also large and so vast areas are imaged regularly with these sensors. NASA distributes the image products as well as a variety of Level 2, 3, and 4 products derived from this rich dataset.

MODIS at NASA
MODIS Land Products
MODIS Cryo Products
MODIS Ocean Color and Sea Surface Temp Products

MERIS @ ESA

Similar to MODIS, MERIS on Envisat provided over a decade of multispectral imaging at moderate resolution. These data are also available from ESA free for research purposes through the ESA PI Portal. Through this portal you can also gain access to a host of other products, from both ESA and 3rd party missions.

ESA PI Portal

Elevation Data

Elevation data are becoming more and more used in geospatial analysis. Sadly, there is yet to be a global, high-resolution DEM that is widely available at no cost. There are a few isolated sources of high-resolution data, but most areas are still not covered.

SRTM

The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was an imaging radar system that flew aboard the U.S. space shuttles. Using SAR interferometry, it was possible to generate a very accurate DEM at 30m posting. However, these data are only available for the U.S. below 60 degrees latitude. The rest of the world is covered at 90m posting. While very course, this is still the best available product in many parts of the world.

Links:
SRTM at JPL
SRTM Data at USGS

OpenTopography.org

While very limited in scope, the lidar-derived DEM data at opentopography.org is some of the highest resolution, publicly-available elevation data in the world. If your area of interest includes the contiguous U.S. and you are using elevation data it is worth checking this site for data availability.

Links:
Open Topography

Canada GeoBase

I’m not a regular user of GeoBase data, but I did use it recently for DEM data for an orthorectification project in Canada. The interface was pretty easy to use and I was able to get what I needed. There catalog looks very comprehensive for Canada and I know they offer access to the Canadian Digital Elevation Dataset (CDED). Website available in both English and French.

Links:
GeoBase Website

ASTER GDEM2

The ASTER GDEM2 is a global elevation dataset derived from the Japanese ASTER sensor aboard NASA’s Terra spacecraft. Given the bilateral nature of these data and the processing effort that went into the product, they are offered for download by both the U.S. and Japanese governments. The GDEM is a nice product in many areas, however, in my own work I have found many locations where the GDEM has significant artifacts or large errors. While they may work great for you, I would recommend careful examination of these data before using them in your projects.

Links:
ASTER GDEM has links to the various locations to download these products.

Database of Environmental Information for Products and Services

Welcome to the Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) Database—a tool to facilitate the purchase of products and services with reduced environmental impacts. The database contains information on mandatory purchase programs contained in FAR Part 23 (Energy Star, CPG, and Biopreferred Products) as well as environmental products available through supply programs such as Ability One and the U.S. General Services Administration.

This database links you to:

- Contract language, specifications, and policies created and used by federal and state governments and others to buy environmentally preferable products and services. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) encourages government purchasers to share successful purchasing language. Please Contact Us to send links to your information.

- Environmental standards and guidelines developed by federal and independent standards-setting organizations including:
    - Design for the Environment (DfE) Program for lower hazard products (EPA)
    - Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines for recycled-content products (EPA)
    - Biopreferred Program for biobased products (US Department of Agriculture)
    - ENERGY STAR® and Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) for energy efficient products (Department of Energy & EPA)
    - WaterSense for water efficient products (EPA)
    - ASTM, ANSI, Green Seal, EcoLogo, Scientific Certification Systems, MBDC Cradle to Cradle and other independent and non-governmental "green" product certification programs.
    - Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program for ozone-depleting chemical substitutes.

- Product vendors and service providers that meet these standards including federal supply programs such as:
    - U.S. General Services Administration
    - Ability One's Skilcraft® Environmental Products

- Other useful sources of information on the environmentally preferable attributes of products and services.

If you are already familiar with the structure of this database, BEGIN YOUR SEARCH. Otherwise, please read About the EPP Database to learn how to use this resource.

Common Crawl is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing an open repository of web crawl data that can be accessed and analyzed by everyone.

The current crawl data set includes three different types of files: ARC raw content, Text Only, and Metadata. The archived crawl data sets contain only ARC raw content files. For more details about the file formats, please see the Common Crawl Wiki.

Common Crawl provides the glue code required to launch Hadoop jobs on Amazon Elastic MapReduce that can run against the crawl corpus residing here in the Amazon Public Data Sets. By utilizing Amazon Elastic MapReduce to access the S3 resident data, end users can bypass costly network transfer costs.

To learn more about Amazon Elastic MapReduce please see the product detail page.

Common Crawl's Hadoop classes and other code can be found in its GitHub repository.

Science Briefs

Since the mid 1990s, GISS scientists have often prepared short articles about their research, sometimes in connection with the publication of journal articles, with the aim of briefly communicating to the public the relevance and even the excitement of our research. These summaries are shorn of most technical language and may be thought of as "popular science" discussions of selected GISS research topics.

Listed below are science briefs which have been written since 2011. Briefs about older research are listed on separate pages for 2006-2010, 2001-2005, and 1995-2000.

News releases about recent GISS research achievements may be found in the Research News pages. Some articles about GISS research prepared by other NASA sites and publications appear amongst the Research Features.

Table Data: Global and Hemispheric Monthly Means and Zonal Annual Means

Plain text files in tabular format of temperature anomalies, i.e. deviations from the corresponding 1951-1980 means.

Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies (Land-Ocean Temperature Index, LOTI)

- Global-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present, updated through most recent month
- Northern Hemisphere-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present, updated through most recent month
- Southern Hemisphere-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present, updated through most recent month
- Zonal annual means, 1880-present, updated through most recent completed year

Note: LOTI provides a more realistic representation of the global mean trends than dTs below; it slightly underestimates warming or cooling trends, since the much larger heat capacity of water compared to air causes a slower and diminished reaction to changes; dTs on the other hand overestimates trends, since it disregards most of the dampening effects of the oceans that cover about two thirds of the earth's surface.

Means Based on Land-Surface Air Temperature Anomalies Only (Meteorological Station Data, dTs)

- Global-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present, updated through most recent month
- Northern Hemisphere-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present, updated through most recent month
- Southern Hemisphere-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present, updated through most recent month
- Zonal annual means, 1880-present, updated through most recent complete calendar year

Gridded Monthly Maps of Temperature Anomaly Data

Users interested in the entire gridded surface air temperature anomaly data may download netcdf files containing selected series on a regular 2°×2° grid or the basic SBBX binary files. Note: These files are large.

Compressed NetCDF files (regular 2x2 degree grid)

- Land-Ocean Temperature Index, 1200km smoothing (23 MB)
- Surface air temperature (no ocean data), 250km smoothing (9 MB)

Compressed basic subbox grid series (equal-area grid)

Offer feedback directly to the engineers who developed them.

 You can reach us by email at: podaac@podaac.jpl.nasa.gov

State of the Ocean 2D (SOTO 2D)

State of the Ocean 2D provides near real-time data layers (vector and image) that are visualized in an HTML5 interface utilizing open-source tools such as Leaflet.js. SOTO 2D data layers are annotated to give contextual descriptions of the ocean's features and events, and kml overlays (ice extent, hurricane tracks, clouds). Some layer implementations include Sea Surface Temperature (SST), wind vectors, and ocean current vectors.

PO.DAAC Web Services

PO.DAAC Web Services are application programming interfaces (APIs) that can be accessed through standard web protocols.  The W3C defines a Web Service in part as, "A software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network," (for the full definition, see http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-arch/#whatis ). The PO.DAAC Web Services use a Representational State Transfer (REST) model with calls issued over a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) connection.  On receipt of a request message, our services return the response in either an Extensible Markup Language (XML) structure or, optionally, a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

PO.DAAC HITIDE (Subsetter) v3.1.x

The HIgh-level Tool for Interactive Data Extraction (HITIDE) is a web-based interface facilitating the search, imaging, and extraction of select Level 2 "swath" datasets from PO.DAAC's archive. HiTIDE's v3.1.x  user interface is powered by a set of Web Services which facilitate machine to machine interoperability.

Webification

Webification (W10n) is ReSTful Webservice technology providing simplified access to PODAAC data and metadata via HTTP/HTTPS protocols with URLs comprised of well-defined parameters. W10n supports major Earth science data formats like NetCDF and HDF 4/5, and abstracts an arbitrary data store as a hierarchical tree of nodes for  each associated attributes which can be interrogated.  Direct access to inner components of the tree is via HTTP requests from either a web browser, script or similar client. Results of W10n calls return specified measurement arrays or metadata elements via subset by array value (v.s. subset by array index), according to supported output formats (JSON, HTML, netCDF) as specified in the URL request.

Datacasting

Datacasting is an RSS-based technology for accessing Earth Science information. With Datacasting, data providers can reach untold numbers of users using standards compliant technology.

Coastal Marine Discovery Service

The NASA's Coastal Marine Discovery Service leverages open source technology for unifying coastal ocean data search and discovery with further extension of data visualization, interrogation and query using the web-based Environmental Analysis System (EASy) GIS framework.

NASA ACCESS-sponsored Web-based Altimetry Service

Altimeter data have become a standard tool in ocean modeling and climate investigations. Altimeter measurements consist of many components in order to arrive at the desired Sea Surface Height (SSH), SSH Anomaly (SSHA), difference of current measurement from a long term Mean Sea Surface (MSS), or Ocean Surface Topography (difference of SSH from the geoid). We are developing a web-based system to allow updating and subsetting of altimeter data.

State Superfund Sites

Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Site Program

Environmental Remediation Databases - Search for information sites in New York State cleaned up through DER Programs.

The Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Site (IHWDS) Program is the State's program for identifying, investigating and cleaning up sites where consequential amounts of hazardous waste may exist. These sites go through a process of investigation, evaluation, cleanup and monitoring that has several distinct stages. For an explanation of the different stages of the investigation and cleanup process, please refer to DER's fact sheets on stages of the investigation and cleanup process.

DER is made aware of potential hazardous waste sites in a variety of ways, including notification by the responsible party and citizen complaints.

An environmental investigation called a Site Characterization (SC) is performed when DER is made aware that hazardous waste has or may have been disposed of at a site. The goal of the SC is to determine whether a site meets the state's definition of an inactive hazardous waste disposal site by confirming the presence of hazardous waste and determining the threat posed by the site to public health or the environment. DER or the potentially responsible party performs the SC. For more information, you can read DER's fact sheet on SCs.

Once the presence of a consequential amount of hazardous waste is confirmed at a site, the site is added to the State's official list of sites and is given a classification code.

Sites that receive a classification of 2 (representing a significant threat to public health and/or the environment and requiring action) usually undergo a detailed environmental investigation, called a remedial investigation. When the parties responsible for the contamination are known, the responsible parties often pay for and perform the investigation and evaluation of cleanup options. At sites where responsible parties cannot be found or are unable or unwilling to fund an investigation, the State pays for the investigation using money from the 1986 Environmental Quality Bond Act, also known as the "State Superfund." The State may try to recover costs from a responsible party after the investigation and cleanup are complete.

Each class 2 site is assigned a project manager. Regional IHWDS Program staff serve as project managers for many inactive hazardous waste disposal sites in their respective regions. Staff in DEC's Albany office serve as project managers for the remaining sites. For sites where state money pays for an investigation, the project manager oversees the investigation and evaluation of cleanup options directly, or he may supervise a consultant hired to do the work. When a responsible party performs an investigation, the project manager reviews and approves investigation work plans and reports and ensures the responsible party performs a thorough and proper investigation. The project manager also works closely with New York State Department of Health staff who ensure that public health concerns are addressed.

The project manager writes the Proposed Remedial Action Plan (PRAP) that outlines the State's preferred method to address the site. The project manager presents the proposed plan at a public meeting and responds to public comments. After a final plan is selected and the Record of Decision (ROD) is approved, DER staff may remain involved with the design and implementation of the cleanup.

DER staff also perform inspections of sites that have been remediated but continue to have cleanup systems or other controls in place.

Chemical and Petroleum Spills

The Problem | The Response

Accidental releases of petroleum, toxic chemicals, gases, and other hazardous materials occur frequently throughout New York State. Even small releases have the potential to endanger public health and contaminate groundwater, surface water, and soils. What is being done about this problem? How can concerned citizens help? The information presented here can answer these and other questions.

The Problem

Every year, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation receives approximately 16,000 reports of confirmed and suspected releases to the environment. Approximately ninety percent of those releases involve petroleum products. The rest involve various hazardous substances, unknown materials, or other materials such as untreated sewage and cooking grease.

Environmental damage from such releases depends on the material spilled and the extent of contamination. Many of these reports are releases of small quantities, typically a few gallons, that are contained and cleaned up quickly with little damage to the environment. In other instances material releases seep through the soil and eventually into the groundwater, which can make water supplies unsafe to drink. Vapors from spilled materials can collect in houses and businesses, creating fire and explosion hazards. Uncontained spills, especially those that impact surface water, can kill or injure plants, fish, and wildlife, and cause damage to their habitats.

The Response

New York State (NYS) responds to reports of petroleum and other hazardous material releases through the Spill Response Program maintained by the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). Spill response staff throughout the State investigate such spill reports and take action based on the type of material spilled, the potential environmental damage, and safety risks to the public.

Both immediate response and continued cleanup vary depending on the type of material spilled and the damage caused. Federal and State law require the spiller, or responsible party, to notify government agencies and to contain, clean up, and dispose of any spilled/contaminated material in order to correct any environmental damage.

This may be performed by a qualified contractor hired by the responsible party. Any delay in containing or recovering a release allows contaminants to spread and may result in more extensive damage and more expensive cleanups. DEC can provide additional resources to local agencies during emergencies and will remain involved if continued cleanup of the environment is required. Continued cleanup is the responsibility of the spiller and is required if contamination and environmental damage remain after the initial containment and recovery. Again, this work may be performed by a qualified contractor hired by the responsible party. Continued cleanup may include determining the extent of contamination, selecting a cleanup technology, and completing corrective actions. The DEC will oversee the process to ensure the actions are protective of public safety, health and the environment.

The public can notify DEC of releases to the environment by calling the NYS Spill Hotline. Federal agencies can be notified by calling the National Response Center.

Water

Managing Our Lakes, Rivers and Coasts

New York's abundant rivers, streams, lakes and coastal waters are used for recreation, fishing, tourism, agriculture and manufacturing. Dams and other infrastructure help us manage our waters.

Though plentiful, the water resources of the state are threatened by chemical contaminants and other pollutants from a wide range of sources.

DEC provides various programs that track the quality of the waters, identify and investigate sources of pollution, control these sources and develop strategies to address water quality threats. DEC programs regulate and provide guidance on water supply withdrawal. DEC also manages floodplains and coastal areas to reduce flood risk to protect New Yorkers from coastal and inland flooding.

New York has an astonishing wealth of land and water resources:

Forests

New York's forests cover over 18.6 million acres

Today New York has more forest than it has had in the past 150 years. New York's forests serve as an important economic and recreational resource. Preserving and protecting our forests benefits local communities and industries, and the state as a whole.

Nearly 3 million acres are classified as Forest Preserve. Comprised of 2.6 million acres in the Adirondack Forest Preserve and 286,000 acres within the Catskill Forest Preserve, these lands represent a majority of all state owned property within the Adirondack and Catskill Parks

The Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) manages more than 770,000 acres of State Forests, which include Reforestation Areas, Multiple-Use Areas, Unique Areas and State Nature and Historic Preserves, throughout New York State.

Additionally, the Department also manages nearly 910,000 acres of conservation easements lands across New York State. More than 785,000 acres (86%) of these lands are located within the Adirondacks.

Watersheds

New York State is divided into 17 watersheds

New York State's watersheds, or drainage basins, are the basis for management, monitoring, and assessment activities.

Everyone lives in a watershed. It might be large or small. All watersheds are part of the bigger environment. What you do at your house affects everyone downstream and around you.

Find watersheds facts and reports about NYS watersheds.

Lakes and Rivers

New York State is richly endowed with freshwater lakes, ponds and reservoirs, as well as portions of two of the five Great Lakes and thousands of miles of rivers and streams.

These inland water bodies serve as the drinking water supplies, provide flood control to protect life and property, and support recreation, tourism, agriculture, fishing, power generation, and manufacturing. These water bodies also provide habitat for aquatic plant and animal life.

Estuaries

An estuary is a place where salty water from the ocean mixes with fresh water from the land and creates a unique and special place for marine species to live, feed, and reproduce. New York's Marine District has several estuaries which are managed cooperatively by DEC with other state, local, and federal government agencies, the scientific community, and direct input from private citizens.

Global Estimate of Surface Ocean pCO2, Total CO2, Total Alkalinity, pH, Omega of Calcite, and Omega of Aragonite

03 September 2014

This page contains data and maps created for our estimate of global surface ocean pH. It is the source for the paper published in Marine Chemistry: "Climatological distributions of pH, pCO2, total CO2, alkalinity,and CaCO3 saturation in the global surface ocean,and temporal changes at selected locations" doi: 10.1016/j.marchem.2014.06.004

There are two databases. One is the individual observations, mostly from the GLODAP project where pCO2 observations from the LDEO database have been merged into the GLODAP file. This is the "observed" database. We also re-ran our interpolation scheme to create an updated pCO2 gridded database, using 2005 as the reference year. Those data and the pH, CO3=, Hydrogen Ion Concentration, etc. are contained in the "calculated" data base.

The documentation for these data sets is HERE.

The database of 16,762 observations including LDEO pCO2 Data is here

The database of 21,084 monthly, gridded data elements including pCO2, calculated TCO2, Calculated Potential and Total Alkalinity, calculated pH, and calculated Omega of Calcite and Aragonite is here.

Abstract

Climatological mean monthly distributions of pH in the total H+ scale, total CO2 concentration (TCO2), and the degree of CaCO3 saturation for the global surface ocean waters (excluding coastal areas) are calculated using a data set for pCO2, alkalinity and nutrient concentrations in surface waters (depths less than 50 m), which is built upon the GLODAP, CARINA and LDEO database. The mutual consistency among these measured parameters is demonstrated using the inorganic carbon chemistry model with the dissociation constants for carbonic acid by Lueker et al. (2000) and for boric acid by Dickson (1990). The global ocean is divided into 24 regions, and the linear potential alkalinity (total alkalinity + nitrate) versus salinity relationships are established for each region. The mean monthly distributions of pH and carbon chemistry parameters for the reference year 2005 are computed using the climatological mean monthly pCO2 data adjusted to a reference year 2005 and the alkalinity estimated from the potential alkalinity versus salinity relationships. The climatological monthly mean values of pCO2 over the global ocean are compiled for a 4° x 5° grid for the reference year 2005, and the gridded data for each of 12 months are included in this database. This is updated version of Takahashi et al. (2009) for the reference year 2000 representing non-El Niño years using a database of about 6.5 million pCO2 data (less coastal areas of North and South America) observed in 1957-2012 (Takahashi et al., 2013). The equatorial zone (4°N-4°S) of the Pacific is excluded from the analysis because of the large interannual changes associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation events. The pH thus calculated ranges from 7.9 to 8.2. Lower values are located in the upwelling regions in the tropical Pacific and in the Arabian and Bering Seas; and higher values are found in the subpolar and polar waters during the spring-summer months of intense photosynthetic production. The vast areas of subtropical oceans have seasonally varying pH values ranging from 8.05 during warmer months to 8.15 during colder months. The warm tropical and subtropical waters are supersaturated by a factor of as much as 4.2 with respect to aragonite and 6.3 for calcite, whereas the cold subpolar and polar waters are less supersaturated only by 1.2 for aragonite and 2 for calcite because of the lower pH values resulting from greater TCO2 concentrations. In the western Arctic Ocean, aragonite undersaturation is observed.

Emergence of innovative courses

Early cMOOCs such as CCK08 and ds106 used innovative pedagogy, with distributed learning materials rather than a video-lecture format, and a focus on education and learning, and digital storytelling respectively[12][13][14][15][16][17]

Following the 2011 launch of three stanford xMOOCs, including Introduction Into AI, launched by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig[42] a number of other innovative courses have emerged. As of May 2014, more than 900 MOOCs are offered by US universities and colleges. As of February 2013 dozens of universities had affiliated with MOOCs, including many international institutions.[37][63] In addition, some organisations operate their own MOOCs – including Google's Power Search.

A range of courses have emerged; "There was a real question of whether this would work for humanities and social science", said Ng. However, psychology and philosophy courses are among Coursera's most popular. Student feedback and completion rates suggest that they are as successful as math and science courses [64] even though the corresponding completion rates are lower.[7]

In January 2012, University of Helsinki launched a Finnish MOOC in programming. The MOOC is used as a way to offer high-schools the opportunity to provide programming courses for their students, even if no local premises or faculty that can organize such courses exist.[65] The course has been offered recurringly, and the top-performing students are admitted to a BSc and MSc program in Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.[65][66] At a meeting on E-Learning and MOOCs, Jaakko Kurhila, Head of studies for University of Helsinki, Department of Computer Science, claimed that to date, there has been over 8000 participants in their MOOCs altogether.[67]

On 18 June 2012, Ali Lemus from Galileo University[68] launched the first Latin American MOOC titled "Desarrollando Aplicaciones para iPhone y iPad"[69] This MOOC is a Spanish remix of Stanford University's popular "CS 193P iPhone Application Development" and had 5,380 students enrolled. The technology used to host the MOOC was the Galileo Educational System platform (GES) which is based on the .LRN project.[70]

"Gender Through Comic Books" was a course taught by Ball State University's Christina Blanch on Instructure's Canvas Network, a MOOC platform launched in November 2012.[71] The course used examples from comic books to teach academic concepts about gender and perceptions.[72]

In November 2012, the University of Miami launched its first high school MOOC as part of Global Academy, its online high school. The course became available for high school students preparing for the SAT Subject Test in biology.[73]

During the Spring 2013 semester, Cathy Davidson and Dan Ariely taught the "Surprise Endings: Social Science and Literature" a SPOC course taught in-person at Duke University and also as a MOOC, with students from Duke running the online discussions.[2]

In the UK of summer 2013, Physiopedia ran their first MOOC regarding Professional Ethics in collaboration with University of the Western Cape in South Africa.[74] This was followed by a second course in 2014, Physiotherapy Management of Spinal Cord Injuries, which was accredited by the World Confederation of Physical Therapy and attracted approximately 4000 participants with a 40% completion rate.[75][76] Physiopedia is the first provider of physiotherapy/physical therapy MOOCs, accessible to participants worldwide[77]

In March 2013, Coursolve piloted a crowdsourced business strategy course for 100 organizations with the University of Virginia.[78] A data science MOOC began in May 2013.[79]

In May 2013 Coursera announced free e-books for some courses in partnership with Chegg, an online textbook-rental company. Students would use Chegg's e-reader, which limits copying and printing and could use the book only while enrolled in the class.[80]

In June 2013, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill launched Skynet University,[81] which offers MOOCs on introductory astronomy. Participants gain access to the university's global network of robotic telescopes, including those in the Chilean Andes and Australia. It incorporates YouTube,[82] Facebook[83] and Twitter.[84]

In July 2013 the University of Tasmania launched Understanding Dementia, the world's first Dementia MOOC. With one of the world's highest completion rates (39%),[85] the course was recognized in the journal Nature.[86]

Startup Veduca[87] launched the first MOOCs in Brazil, in partnership with the University of São Paulo in June 2013. The first two courses were Basic Physics, taught by Vanderlei Salvador Bagnato, and Probability and Statistics, taught by Melvin Cymbalista and André Leme Fleury.[88] In the first two weeks following the launch at Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo, more than 10,000 students enrolled.[89][90]

Startup Wedubox (Finalist at MassChallenge 2013)[91] launched the first MOOC in finance and third MOOC in Latam, the MOOC was created by Jorge Borrero (MBA Universidad de la Sabana) with the title "WACC and the cost of capital" it reached 2.500 students in Dec 2013 only 2 months after the launch.[citation needed]

In the fall 2014 Georgia Institute of Technology launched the first MOOD (massive online open degree) (Master's degree) in computer science for $7000 by partnering with Udacity and AT&T.[92][93][94]

In September 2014, the high street retailer, Marks & Spencer partnered up with University of Leeds to construct an MOOC business course "which will use case studies from the Company Archive alongside research from the University to show how innovation and people are key to business success. The course will be offered by the UK based MOOC platform, FutureLearn.[95]

On 16 March 2015, the University of Cape Town launched its first MOOC, Medicine and the Arts on the UK-led platform, Futurelearn.[96]

In July 2015, OpenClassrooms, jointly with IESA Multimedia, launches first MOOC-based Bachelor degree in multimedia project management, recognized by French state.[97]

Student experience and pedagogy

Students served

By June 2012 more than 1.5 million people had registered for classes through Coursera, Udacity and/or edX.[98][99] As of 2013, the range of students registered appears to be broad, diverse and non-traditional, but concentrated among English-speakers in rich countries. By March 2013, Coursera alone had registered about 2.8 million learners.[51] By October 2013, Coursera enrollment continued to surge, surpassing 5 million, while edX had independently reached 1.3 million.[64]

A course billed as "Asia's first MOOC" given by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology through Coursera starting in April 2013 registered 17,000 students. About 60% were from "rich countries" with many of the rest from middle-income countries in Asia, South Africa, Brazil or Mexico. Fewer students enrolled from areas with more limited access to the internet, and students from the People's Republic of China may have been discouraged by Chinese government policies.[100]

Koller stated in May 2013 that a majority of the people taking Coursera courses had already earned college degrees.[101]

According to a Stanford University study of a more general group of students "active learners" – anybody who participated beyond just registering – found that 64% of high school active learners were male and 88% were male for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses.[102]

A study from Stanford University's Learning Analytics group identified four types of students: auditors, who watched video throughout the course, but took few quizzes or exams; completers, who viewed most lectures and took part in most assessments; disengaged learners, who quickly dropped the course; and sampling learners, who might only occasionally watch lectures.[102] They identified the following percentages in each group:[103]

Jonathan Haber focused on questions of what students are learning and student demographics. About half the students taking US courses are from other countries and do not speak English as their first language. He found some courses to be meaningful, especially about reading comprehension. Video lectures followed by multiple choice questions can be challenging since they are often the "right questions." Smaller discussion boards paradoxically offer the best conversations. Larger discussions can be "really, really thoughtful and really, really misguided", with long discussions becoming rehashes or "the same old stale left/right debate."[104] MOOC helps everyone to learn according to their own pace . It helps us to access lectures from prestigious universities . It is also an cost effective medium.

MIT and Stanford University offered initial MOOCs in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Since engineering courses need prerequisites so at the outset upper-level engineering courses were nearly absent from the MOOC list. Now several universities are presenting undergraduate and advanced-level engineering courses .[105][106][107]

Educator experience

In 2013, the Chronicle of Higher Education surveyed 103 professors who had taught MOOCs. "Typically a professor spent over 100 hours on his MOOC before it even started, by recording online lecture videos and doing other preparation", though some instructors' pre-class preparation was "a few dozen hours." The professors then spent 8–10 hours per week on the course, including participation in discussion forums.[108]

The medians were: 33,000 students enrollees; 2,600 passing; and 1 teaching assistant helping with the class. 74% of the classes used automated grading, and 34% used peer grading. 97% of the instructors used original videos, 75% used open educational resources and 27% used other resources. 9% of the classes required a physical textbook and 5% required an e-book.[108][109]

Unlike traditional courses, MOOCs require additional skills, provided by videographers, instructional designers, IT specialists and platform specialists. Georgia Tech professor Karen Head reports that 19 people work on their MOOCs and that more are needed.[110] The platforms have availability requirements similar to media/content sharing websites, due to the large number of enrollees. MOOCs typically use cloud computing and are often created with authoring systems. Authoring tools for the creation of MOOCs are specialized packages of educational software like Elicitus, IMC Content Studio and Lectora that are easy-to-use and support e-learning standards like SCORM and AICC.

Completion rates

Completion rates are typically lower than 10%, with a steep participation drop starting in the first week. In the course Bioelectricity, Fall 2012 at Duke University, 12,725 students enrolled, but only 7,761 ever watched a video, 3,658 attempted a quiz, 345 attempted the final exam, and 313 passed, earning a certificate.[111][112]

Early data from Coursera suggest a completion rate of 7%–9%.[113] Most registered students intend to explore the topic rather than complete the course, according to Koller and Ng. The completion rate for students who complete the first assignment is about 45 percent. Students paying $50 for a feature designed to prevent cheating on exams have completion rates of about 70 percent.[114]

One online survey published a "top ten" list of reasons for dropping out.[115] These were that the course required too much time, or was too difficult or too basic. Reasons related to poor course design included "lecture fatigue" from courses that were just lecture videos, lack of a proper introduction to course technology and format, clunky technology and abuse on discussion boards. Hidden costs were cited, including required readings from expensive textbooks written by the instructor that also significantly limited students' access to learning material.[7] Other non-completers were "just shopping around" when they registered, or were participating for knowledge rather than a credential. Other reasons for the poor completion rates include the workload, length and difficulty of a course.[7] Providers are exploring multiple techniques to increase the often single-digit completion rates in many MOOCs.

About 10% of the students who sign up typically complete the course.[3] Most participants participate peripherally ("lurk"). For example, one of the first MOOCs in 2008 had 2200 registered members, of whom 150 actively interacted at various times.[116]

Learners control where, what, how and with whom they learn, although different learners choose to exercise more or less of that control.[117]

Students include traditional and distance university students, along with degreed professionals, educators, business people, researchers and others interested in internet culture.[113]

The effectiveness of MOOCs is an open question as completion rates are substantially less than traditional online education courses.[118][119] Alraimi et al. explained in their research model a substantial percentage of the variance for the intention to continue using MOOCs, which is significantly influenced by perceived reputation, perceived openness, perceived usefulness, perceived, and user satisfaction. Perceived reputation and perceived openness were the strongest predictors and have not previously been examined in the context of MOOCs.[119]

Instructional design

10 Steps to Developing an Online Course: Walter Sinnott-Armstrong on YouTube, Duke University[120]

Designing, developing and running (Massive) Online Courses by George Siemens, Athabasca University[121]

Many MOOCs use video lectures, employing the old form of teaching (lecturing) using a new technology.[118][122] Thrun testified before the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) that MOOC "courses are 'designed to be challenges,' not lectures, and the amount of data generated from these assessments can be evaluated 'massively using machine learning' at work behind the scenes. This approach, he said, dispels 'the medieval set of myths' guiding teacher efficacy and student outcomes, and replaces it with evidence-based, 'modern, data-driven' educational methodologies that may be the instruments responsible for a 'fundamental transformation of education' itself".[123]

Some view the videos and other material produced by the MOOC as the next form of the textbook. "MOOC is the new textbook", according to David Finegold of Rutgers University.[124] A study of edX student habits found that certificate-earning students generally stop watching videos longer than 6 to 9 minutes. They viewed the first 4.4 minutes (median) of 12- to 15-minute videos.[125] Some traditional schools blend online and offline learning, sometimes called flipped classrooms. Students watch lectures online at home and work on projects and interact with faculty while in class. Such hybrids can even improve student performance in traditional in-person classes. One fall 2012 test by San Jose State and edX found that incorporating content from an online course into a for-credit campus-based course increased pass rates to 91% from as low as 55% without the online component. "We do not recommend selecting an online-only experience over a blended learning experience", says Coursera's Andrew Ng.[64]

Because of massive enrollments, MOOCs require instructional design that facilitates large-scale feedback and interaction. The two basic approaches are:

- Peer-review and group collaboration
- Automated feedback through objective, online assessments, e.g. quizzes and exams[126] Machine grading of written assignments is also underway.[127]

So-called connectivist MOOCs rely on the former approach; broadcast MOOCs rely more on the latter.[128] This marks a key distinction between cMOOCs where the 'C' stands for 'connectivist', and xMOOCs where the x stands for extended (as in TEDx, edX) and represents that the MOOC is designed to be in addition to something else (university courses for example).[129]

Assessment can be the most difficult activity to conduct online, and online assessments can be quite different from the bricks-and-mortar version.[126] Special attention has been devoted to proctoring and cheating.[130]

Peer review is often based upon sample answers or rubrics, which guide the grader on how many points to award different answers. These rubrics cannot be as complex for peer grading as for teaching assistants. Students are expected to learn via grading others[131] and become more engaged with the course.[7] Exams may be proctored at regional testing centers. Other methods, including "eavesdropping technologies worthy of the C.I.A." allow testing at home or office, by using webcams, or monitoring mouse clicks and typing styles.[130] Special techniques such as adaptive testing may be used, where the test tailors itself given the student's previous answers, giving harder or easier questions accordingly.

"The most important thing that helps students succeed in an online course is interpersonal interaction and support", says Shanna Smith Jaggars, assistant director of Columbia University's Community College Research Center. Her research compared online-only and face-to-face learning in studies of community-college students and faculty in Virginia and Washington state. Among her findings: In Virginia, 32% of students failed or withdrew from for-credit online courses, compared with 19% for equivalent in-person courses.[64]

Assigning mentors to students is another interaction-enhancing technique.[64] In 2013 Harvard offered a popular class, The Ancient Greek Hero, instructed by Gregory Nagy and taken by thousands of Harvard students over prior decades. It appealed to alumni to volunteer as online mentors and discussion group managers. About 10 former teaching fellows also volunteered. The task of the volunteers, which required 3–5 hours per week, was to focus online class discussion. The edX course registered 27,000 students.[132]

Research by Kop and Fournier[117] highlighted as major challenges the lack of social presence and the high level of autonomy required. Techniques for maintaining connection with students include adding audio comments on assignments instead of writing them, participating with students in the discussion forums, asking brief questions in the middle of the lecture, updating weekly videos about the course and sending congratulatory emails on prior accomplishments to students who are slightly behind.[64] Grading by peer review has had mixed results. In one example, three fellow students grade one assignment for each assignment that they submit. The grading key or rubric tends to focus the grading, but discourages more creative writing.[104]

A. J. Jacobs in an op-ed in the New York Times graded his experience in 11 MOOC classes overall as a "B".[133] He rated his professors as '"B+", despite "a couple of clunkers", even comparing them to pop stars and "A-list celebrity professors." Nevertheless, he rated teacher-to-student interaction as a "D" since he had almost no contact with the professors. The highest rated ("A") aspect of Jacobs' experience was the ability to watch videos at any time. Student-to-student interaction and assignments both received "B-". Study groups that didn't meet, trolls on message boards and the relative slowness of online vs. personal conversations lowered that rating. Assignments included multiple choice quizzes and exams as well as essays and projects. He found the multiple choice tests stressful and peer graded essays painful. He completed only 2 of the 11 classes.[133][134]

Industry

MOOCs are widely seen as a major part of a larger disruptive innovation taking place in higher education.[135][136][137] In particular, the many services offered under traditional university business models are predicted to become unbundled and sold to students individually or in newly formed bundles.[138][139] These services include research, curriculum design, content generation (such as textbooks), teaching, assessment and certification (such as granting degrees) and student placement. MOOCs threaten existing business models by potentially selling teaching, assessment, and/or placement separately from the current package of services.[135][140][141]

President Barack Obama has cited recent developments, including the online learning innovations at Carnegie Mellon University, Arizona State University and Georgia Institute of Technology, as having potential to reduce the rising costs of higher education.[142]

James Mazoue, Director of Online Programs at Wayne State University describes one possible innovation:

The next disruptor will likely mark a tipping point: an entirely free online curriculum leading to a degree from an accredited institution. With this new business model, students might still have to pay to certify their credentials, but not for the process leading to their acquisition. If free access to a degree-granting curriculum were to occur, the business model of higher education would dramatically and irreversibly change.[143]

But how universities will benefit by "giving our product away free online" is unclear.[144]

No one's got the model that's going to work yet. I expect all the current ventures to fail, because the expectations are too high. People think something will catch on like wildfire. But more likely, it's maybe a decade later that somebody figures out how to do it and make money.

— James Grimmelmann, New York Law School professor[144]

Principles of openness inform the creation, structure and operation of MOOCs. The extent to which practices of Open Design in educational technology[145] are applied vary.

Fee opportunities

In the freemium business model the basic product – the course content – is given away free. "Charging for content would be a tragedy", said Andrew Ng. But "premium" services such as certification or placement would be charged a fee however financial aids are given in some cases.[51]

Course developers could charge licensing fees for educational institutions that use its materials. Introductory or "gateway" courses and some remedial courses may earn the most fees. Free introductory courses may attract new students to follow-on fee-charging classes. Blended courses supplement MOOC material with face-to-face instruction. Providers can charge employers for recruiting its students. Students may be able to pay to take a proctored exam to earn transfer credit at a degree-granting university, or for certificates of completion.[144] Udemy allows teachers to sell online courses, with the course creators keeping 70–85% of the proceeds and intellectual property rights.[148]

Coursera found that students who paid $30 to $90 were substantially more likely to finish the course. The fee was ostensibly for the company's identity-verification program, which confirms that they took and passed a course.[64]

In February 2013 the American Council on Education (ACE) recommended that its members provide transfer credit from a few MOOC courses, though even the universities who deliver the courses had said that they would not.[151] The University of Wisconsin offered multiple, competency-based bachelor's and master's degrees starting Fall 2013, the first public university to do so on a system-wide basis. The university encouraged students to take online-courses such as MOOCs and complete assessment tests at the university to receive credit.[citation needed] As of 2013 few students had applied for college credit for MOOC classes.[citation needed] Colorado State University-Global Campus received no applications in the year after they offered the option.[152]

Academic Partnerships is a company that helps public universities move their courses online. According to its chairman, Randy Best "We started it, frankly, as a campaign to grow enrollment. But 72 to 84 percent of those who did the first course came back and paid to take the second course."[153]

While Coursera takes a larger cut of any revenue generated – but requires no minimum payment – the not-for-profit edX has a minimum required payment from course providers, but takes a smaller cut of any revenues, tied to the amount of support required for each course.[154]

Challenges and criticisms

The MOOC Guide[155] suggests five possible challenges for cMOOCs:

- Relying on user-generated content can create a chaotic learning environment
- Digital literacy is necessary to make use of the online materials
- The time and effort required from participants may exceed what students are willing to commit to a free online course
- Once the course is released, content will be reshaped and reinterpreted by the massive student body, making the course trajectory difficult for instructors to control
- Participants must self-regulate and set their own goals

These general challenges in effective MOOC development are accompanied by criticism by journalists and academics.

Some dispute that the "territorial" dimensions of MOOCs[156] have received insufficient discussion or data-backed analysis, namely: 1. the true geographical diversity of enrolls in/completes courses; 2. the implications of courses scaling across country borders, and potential difficulties with relevance and knowledge transfer; and 3. the need for territory-specific study of locally relevant issues and needs.

Other features associated with early MOOCs, such as open licensing of content, open structure and learning goals, and community-centeredness, may not be present in all MOOC projects.[4]

Effects on the structure of higher education were lamented for example by Moshe Y. Vardi, who finds an "absence of serious pedagogy in MOOCs", and indeed in all of higher education. He criticized the format of "short, unsophisticated video chunks, interleaved with online quizzes, and accompanied by social networking."[clarification needed] An underlying reason is simple cost cutting pressures, which could hamstring the higher education industry.[157]

The changes predicted from MOOCs generated objections in some quarters. The San Jose State University philosophy faculty wrote in an open letter to Harvard University professor and MOOC teacher Michael Sandel:

Should one-size-fits-all vendor-designed blended courses become the norm, we fear two classes of universities will be created: one, well-funded colleges and universities in which privileged students get their own real professor; the other, financially stressed private and public universities in which students watch a bunch of video-taped lectures.[158]

Cary Nelson, former president of the American Association of University Professors claimed that MOOCs are not a reliable means of supplying credentials, stating that "It’s fine to put lectures online, but this plan only degrades degree programs if it plans to substitute for them." Sandra Schroeder, chair of the Higher Education Program and Policy Council for the American Federation of Teachers expressed concern that "These students are not likely to succeed without the structure of a strong and sequenced academic program."[159]

With a 60% majority, the Amherst College faculty rejected the opportunity to work with edX based on a perceived incompatibility with their seminar-style classes and personalized feedback. Some were concerned about issues such as the "information dispensing" teaching model of lectures followed by exams, the use of multiple-choice exams and peer-grading. The Duke University faculty took a similar stance in the spring of 2013. The effect of MOOCs on second- and third-tier institutions and of creating a professorial "star system" were among other concerns.[127]

At least one alternative to MOOCs has advocates: Distributed open collaborative courses (DOCC) challenge the roles of the instructor, hierarchy, money and massiveness. DOCC recognizes that the pursuit of knowledge may be achieved better by not using a centralized singular syllabus, that expertise is distributed throughout all the participants and does not just reside with one or two individuals.[160]

Another alternative to MOOCs is the Self-Paced Online Course (SPOC) which provides a high degree of flexibility. Students can decide on their own pace and with which session they would like to begin their studies. As of 2015, there are more than 800 self-paced courses, including 20% of all MOOCs on Class Central, a MOOC-aggregator, and the MOOC provider Coursera has also introduced sessions with soft deadlines.[161]

Although the purpose of MOOCs is ultimately to educate more people, recent criticisms include accessibility and a Westernized curriculum that lead to a failure to reach the very audience they were intended to save.[162]

MOOCs have been criticized for a perceived lack of academic rigor as well as the monetization strategies adopted by providers. In MOOCs: A University Qualification in 24 Hours? Michael Shea writes "By offering courses that are near-impossible to fail and charging up front fees for worthless certificates, Coursera is simply running a high-tech version of the kind of scams that have been run by correspondence colleges for decades."[163]
