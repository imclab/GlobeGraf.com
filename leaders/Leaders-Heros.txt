Leaders / Heroes

The world is filled with visionaries thought leaders teachers and greens gurus. Let's celebrate them and learn from them, make them into the cultural icons we see in Hollywood and professional sports today - give those innovators with the greatest impact the same hyper attention & mega stardom bestowed upon today's pop stars - to focus and inspire us to create a brighter future.

Feeling the Heat: Climate Science and the Basis of the Convention

Where are we now? → How did we get here? → Where are we going?

Where are we now?

The year 2013 provided more clarity about human-generated climate change than ever before. On 27 September 2013, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the Working Group 1 contribution to its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), which looks at the science of climate change. It is categorical in its conclusion: climate change is real and man is the main cause.

The release of the first instalment of AR 5 came in the wake of an unusual number of severe weather-related disasters, and at the head of an almost unbroken series of the hottest years on record, with the period 2000 to 2009 the warmest decade on record so far.

There are some basic well-established links:

- The concentration of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere is directly linked to the average global temperature on Earth;
- The concentration has been rising steadily, and mean global temperatures along with it, since the time of the Industrial Revolution; and
- The most abundant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is the product of burning fossil fuels.

Greenhouse gases occur naturally and are essential to the survival of humans and millions of other living things, through keeping some of the sun’s warmth from reflecting back into space and making Earth livable. But it’s a matter of scale. A century and a half of industrialization, including clear-felling forests and certain farming methods, has driven up quantities of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As populations, economies and standards of living grow, so does the cumulative level of GHG emissions.

First steps to a safer future: Introducing The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994. Today, it has near-universal membership. The 195 countries that have ratified the Convention are called Parties to the Convention.

The UNFCCC is a “Rio Convention”, one of three adopted at the “Rio Earth Summit” in 1992. Its sister Rio Conventions are the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. The three are intrinsically linked. It is in this context that the Joint Liaison Group was set up to boost cooperation among the three Conventions, with the ultimate aim of developing synergies in their activities on issues of mutual concern. It now also incorporates the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.

Preventing “dangerous” human interference with the climate system is the ultimate aim of the UNFCCC.

Climate change is arguably the greatest environmental challenge facing us in the twenty-first century. Its importance has been recognised in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The consequences of a warming climate are far-reaching, potentially affecting fresh water resources, global food production and sea level. Threatening impacts on the natural environment and life on Earth for generations to come, climate change is high on political, strategic and economic agendas worldwide.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

The World Meteorological Organization
Headquarters in Geneva. IPCC Secretariat
is hosted by WMO

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts. In the same year, the UN General Assembly endorsed the action by WMO and UNEP in jointly establishing the IPCC.
The IPCC is a scientific body under the auspices of the United Nations (UN). It reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change. It does not conduct any research nor does it monitor climate related data or parameters.
Thousands of scientists from all over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC on a voluntary basis. Review is an essential part of the IPCC process, to ensure an objective and complete assessment of current information. IPCC aims to reflect a range of views and expertise. The Secretariat coordinates all the IPCC work and liaises with Governments. It is supported by WMO and UNEP and hosted at WMO headquarters in Geneva.
The IPCC is an intergovernmental body. It is open to all member countries of the United Nations (UN) and WMO. Currently 195 countries are members of the IPCC. Governments participate in the review process and the plenary Sessions, where main decisions about the IPCC work programme are taken and reports are accepted, adopted and approved. The IPCC Bureau Members, including the Chair, are also elected during the plenary Sessions.
Because of its scientific and intergovernmental nature, the IPCC embodies a unique opportunity to provide rigorous and balanced scientific information to decision makers. By endorsing the IPCC reports, governments acknowledge the authority of their scientific content. The work of the organization is therefore policy-relevant and yet policy-neutral, never policy-prescriptive.

Open Challenges

NOAA and NASA Coastal Flooding Innovation Challenge

Coastal communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the risk of damage from coastal inundation. We only have to remember the recent impact of Hurricane Sandy on communities in the northeast to see the potential damage that a single storm can cause. This featured challenge of the International Space Apps Challenge is to create tools and provide information so communities can prepare for coastal floods. Through the use of data, visualizations, and simulations, you can help people understand their exposure to coastal hazards and their increased vulnerability due to population increase and sea level rise. Visit the resources tab to find datasets, web services, and tools that will help you compete in the Space Apps Challenge on the coastal impacts of climate change.

Space Apps Challenge

Want to create an app about climate? The International Space Apps Challenge is an international mass collaboration offering four climate-related challenges. Space Apps is a two-day event (April 12-13, 2014) that has about 40 challenges organized around Earth and space themes (see sample challenges below). Teams of technologists, scientists, designers, artists, educators entrepreneurs, developers and students across the globe collaborate and engage with publicly available data to design innovative solutions for global challenges. Visit the Resources tab to find datasets, web services, and tools that will help you compete in the Space Apps Challenge on the coastal impacts of climate change.

Coastal Inundation in Your Community
Coastal communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the risk of damage and danger from flooding. Your challenge is to create tools and provide information so communities can prepare for coastal inundation. Through the use of data, visualization, citizen engagement, and simulations, you can help people understand their exposure to coastal inundation hazards and their increased vulnerability due to population increase and sea level rise.

Climate and My Neighborhood: Visualizing Location-Specific Climate Projections on Mobile Devices
What apps would you build if you had access to climate projections for the rest of this century? How would you visualize these climate projections and their impacts to effectively engage policy makers, managers, planners, educators, and the general public? This challenge focuses on the creation of a visualization interface that would allow location-specific access to climate data sets using coordinates specified by the user or from mobile devices.

Cool it! Low-Cost Temperature Micronets and City Alerts
Create a sensor kit to measure temperature and relative humidity in several locations in real time. You could also create a real-time micronet of sensor kits and use their data to understand local environmental conditions. This data could even be used to educate the community about the urban heat island effect, weather, and climate.

Community Visions of Climate Adaptation
Create inspiring and actionable community plans about climate adaptation. Communities can prepare for climate change in plenty of ways and base their plans on the latest scientific data. Work with community residents, urban planners, and city officials to create these plans so they are realistic and reflect community needs. You can use scientific visualizations, imagery, data, graphics, and artist renderings as motivation and inputs for creating detailed maps and plans of action for the next 10, 20, or 50 years.

Private Sector Challenge: Esri Climate Resilience Challenge

Learn about the Esri Climate Resilience Challenge, which challenges innovators to develop apps and maps using the Esri ArcGIS Platform to help communities, see, understand, and prepare for climate risks. Apps may help communities prepare for, react to, and recover from, severe events caused by climate or enabling every day changes to reduce our carbon footprint. They could address challenges in public safety, transportation, economic development, healthcare, and more.

Perception, Action & Cognition
http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5686&org=NSF&sel_org=NSF&from=fund
SYNOPSIS

Supports research on perception, action and cognition. Emphasis is on research strongly grounded in theory. Central research topics for consideration by the Perception, Action, and Cognition panel include vision, audition, haptics, attention, memory, reasoning, written and spoken discourse, and motor control. The program encompasses a wide range of theoretical perspectives, such as symbolic computation, connectionism, ecological, nonlinear dynamics, and complex systems, and a variety of methodologies including both experimental studies and modeling. The PAC program is open to co-review of proposals submitted to other programs (e.g., Linguistics, Developmental and Learning Sciences, Cognitive Neuroscience, etc). Proposals may involve clinical populations, animals, or computational modeling only if the work has direct impact on basic issues of human perception, action, or cognition.

Sustainability Research Networks Competition  (SRN)
http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503645&org=NSF&sel_org=NSF&from=fund
SYNOPSIS

The goal of the Sustainability Research Networks (SRN) competition is to bring together multidisciplinary teams of researchers, educators, managers, policymakers and other stakeholders to conduct collaborative research that addresses fundamental challenges in sustainability. The 2014 SRN competition will fund research networks with a focus on urban sustainability.

Proposals should identify an ambitious and nationally important theme in urban sustainability, present a creative and innovative research agenda that builds upon existing work in this area, and describe how a network of researchers and other stakeholders will be supported that  integrates a variety of disciplines, sectors and backgrounds in order to create new perspectives and  yield significant new understanding and knowledge.

The Sustainability Research Networks competition is part of the growing NSF investment in its Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) portfolio (www.nsf.gov/sees/). Challenges associated with broadly based SEES goals will be met by supporting fundamental science and engineering research and education needed to understand and overcome the barriers to sustainable human and environmental wellbeing and to forge reasoned pathways to a sustainable future. NSF aims to support members of the academic research community for projects which produce discoveries and knowledge that will inform decisions leading to environmental, energy, social and cultural sustainability. NSF support will advance the frontiers of conceptual, empirical and computational research in science, engineering and education so that the nation has the knowledge base to inform policies on sustainability.

Antarctic Artists and Writers Program

PROGRAM GUIDELINES

DUE DATES

Full Proposal Deadline Date:  May 1, 2014

May 1, Annually Thereafter

Proposals will be considered for field support in Antarctica beginning no sooner than a year after the May proposal deadline. Proposals will be considered for work aboard ship in the Southern Ocean beginning no sooner than seven months after the May proposal deadline.

SYNOPSIS

The Antarctic Artists and Writers Program furnishes U.S. Antarctic Program operational support, and round-trip economy air tickets between the United States and the Southern Hemisphere, to artists and writers whose work requires them to be in the Antarctic to complete their proposed project. The Program does not provide any funding to participants, including for such items as salaries, materials, completion of the envisioned works, or any other purpose.

U.S. Antarctic Program infrastructure consists of three year-round stations and numerous austral-summer research camps in Antarctica, research ships in the Southern Ocean, and surface and air transportation.  These assets support the artist and writer projects.  The main purpose of the U.S. Antarctic Program is scientific research and education.

The Antarctic Artists and Writers Program supports writing and artistic projects specifically designed to increase understanding and appreciation of the Antarctic and of human activities on the southernmost continent.

The program does not support short-term projects that are essentially journalistic in nature. See Section IX (Other NSF Programs.)

Partnerships for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research- Technology Translation  (PFI: AIR-TT)

PROGRAM GUIDELINES

Solicitation  13-575

DUE DATES

Full Proposal Deadline Date:  May 1, 2014

SYNOPSIS

The NSF Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) program within the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships (IIP) is an umbrella for two complementary subprograms, Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) and Building Innovation Capacity (BIC). In the final analysis, both programs are concerned with the movement of academic research discoveries into the marketplace although each focuses on different stages along the innovation spectrum. The subject of this solicitation is PFI: AIR Technology Translation (TT) only.  The PFI: AIR-TT solicitation is intended to help bridge the funding gap between existing research discoveries that validate relevant science and engineering fundamentals and their translation through proof-of-concept, prototype, or scale-up along a path toward commercialization and engage faculty and students in entrepreneurial/innovative thinking.

http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/pfi/bic.jsp
Building innovation capacity (BIC)

The NSF Partnership for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (BIC) program supports academia-industry partnerships to focus on post-discovery, academic-led research.

- Partnerships consisting of 1 academic institution and at least 1 industry partner
- An interdisciplinary approach including at least the following 3 components: engineering; computer science; and social, behavioral, and/or cognitive science
- Building technological innovation capacity with significant potential for economic and societal impact
- Building human innovation capacity by activating academe-industry partnerships and developing the next generation of entrepreneurs (students and post-docs)
- Current Topic: Key platform technologies that enable "smart" service systems

EarthScope

PROGRAM GUIDELINES

Solicitation  14-552

DUE DATES

Full Proposal Deadline Date:  August 25, 2014

August 23, Annually Thereafter

SYNOPSIS

EarthScope is an Earth science program to explore the 4-dimensional structure of the North American continent. The EarthScope Program provides a framework for broad, integrated studies across the Earth sciences, including research on fault properties and the earthquake process, strain transfer, magmatic and hydrous fluids in the crust and mantle, plate boundary processes, large-scale continental deformation, continental structure and evolution, and composition and structure of the deep Earth. In addition, EarthScope offers a centralized forum for Earth science education at all levels and an excellent opportunity to develop cyberinfrastructure to integrate, distribute, and analyze diverse data sets.

The EarthScope Facility, consisting of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD), and the USArray, is a multi-purpose array of instruments and observatories that greatly expands the observational capabilities of the Earth sciences and permits us to advance our understanding of the structure, evolution and dynamics of the North American continent.

This Solicitation calls for single or collaborative proposals to conduct scientific research and/or education and outreach activities within North America that make use of capabilities and/or data provided through the EarthScope Facility to further the scientific and educational goals of EarthScope, as described in the 2010 EarthScope Science Plan and/or EarthScope Education and Outreach Implementation Plan.

About Dot Earth
By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to reach nine billion, essentially adding two Chinas to the number of people alive today. Those billions will be seeking food, water and other resources on a planet where, scientists say, humans are already shaping climate and the web of life. In Dot Earth, which recently moved from the news side of The Times to the Opinion section, Andrew C. Revkin examines efforts to balance human affairs with the planet’s limits. Conceived in part with support from a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, Dot Earth tracks relevant developments from suburbia to Siberia. The blog is an interactive exploration of trends and ideas with readers and experts.

"Climate Art:
New Ways of Seeing Data"

10/12-11/27, at the IMC Lab + Gallery, 56 W22 st. 6 fl, NY, NY
Produced by the IMC Lab + Gallery, Curated by Isabel Walcott Draves, With the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation & NRDC,

Marfa Dialogues / New York

Artworks by: Ursula Endlicher, Ben Fry, Aaron Koblin, Nathalie Miebach, Camille Seaman and Karolina Sobecka

Conversation between: Maya Lin, Artist and Frances Beinecke, President NRDC (11/4, 6-8PM at WYNC Greene Performance Space, 44 Charlton St. NY, NY - Watch Live )
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
NEW YORK, NY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2013 — The IMC Lab + Gallery is pleased to present "Climate Art: New Ways of Seeing Data", a data visualization show, in collaboration with the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Ballroom Marfa  & NRDC, curated by Isabel Draves, founder of LISA (Leaders in Software and Art).  This exhibit will be on view October 12 through November 27 as part of Marfa Dialogues/NY, a citywide examination of climate change science, environmental activism and artistic practice taking place throughout New York this October and November. Marfa Dialogues/NY will feature more than 20 Program Partners, including The IMC Lab + Gallery, NRDC, and a spectrum of exhibitions, performance, and interdisciplinary discussions at the intersection of the arts and climate change.

Can the things we once thought of as infinite be quantified?  If they are not infinite, when will they end?

Featuring work by Aaron Koblin, Ben Fry, Ursula Endlicher, Nathalie Miebach, Karolina Sobecka, and Camille Seaman, this collection of works brings together for the first time a selection of pieces by established software artists that attempt to measure the immeasurable: the directed gaze, existence, the sky, power.  Looked at through the lens of Climate Change, these works make us think about our interaction with the natural world, and whether something that used to seem impassive, impenetrable, and immovable -- the globe, the bedrock we stand on, this Earth -- is in fact as fragile as a cloud.

If taking the measure of something means forming an opinion about it, the data driving these pieces make us think more carefully about the logistics of our environment.  The exhibit invites the viewer to notice our ecosystem and consider our impact upon it as a real and quantifiable force.

"In an era of climate change and species extinction, it only makes sense that we try to document the minutiae of what remains.  But it is just as logical to pause from time to time to consider what cannot be calculated". Akiko Busch, Author, The Incidental Steward: Reflections on Citizen Science

A Discussion with Maya Lin and Frances Beinecke Connecting Art and Climate

On Monday, November 4th, two of the leading voices on the issue of climate change -- artist and honorary NRDC Trustee Maya Lin and NRDC President Frances Beinecke -- will discuss the critical role artists, advocates and scientists play in addressing climate change, the role of art in mobilizing and educating the public, and the great potential for environmentally focused artwork to affect climate change policy. The interactive discussion, part of the Marfa Dialogues / New York series, will use Maya Lin's most recent project, What is Missing?, as an example of collaborations to engage the public about climate change. Anne Pasternak, President and Artistic Director of Creative Time will moderate the discussion.

- There is actually a disease called Alien hand syndrome, in which the person with AHS has no conscious control over his 'alien hand' and will blurt things out like: "I swear I'm not doing this".
- The Emerald Cockroach Wasp disables the escaping reflex of cockroaches, leads them to its burrow by pulling their antennae, lays a 2mm white egg into their abdomen and buries them. Then the wasp larvae eat the roaches organs keeping them alive for 8 days until they enter pupal stage. Eventually adult wasps emerge from the cockroaches abdomen.

New support opportunities exist for tech-based art, such as commercializing invention and tapping a new generation of collectors, patrons and sponsors. But tech-based art is still art, which suffers from deep cultural inadequacies in the US. Based on travel and discussion both inside and outside the US, observations about the art and technology landscape and opportunities for future support are presented. Details for an “Arts Lab,” a unique hybrid art center and research lab, are specified.

Extra-organizational Activists & Nonprofits Using the Social Web for Their Cause

As I mentioned last week, I am talking with a marketing class at New College's Green MBA program on Sunday about how nonprofits can use social media for marketing. I figured I'd share my link lists of resources with you, as well as with the students. Besides, it is a lot greener for me to post the links for them than to give them printed handouts!

Many of my examples are of what Allison Fine, author of Momentum: Igniting Social Change in the Connected Age, calls "extra-organizational activists." During my interview with her for NetSquared she said, "Some of the most exciting things going on are what individuals are doing by themselves online, through a meet-up or through a blog or an email, and how organizations learn how to leverage that passion, I think, will prove how successful they can be in this new era."

I've also created lists of environmental and other nonprofits using blogs, podcasts, videos, Flickr and MySpace along with some resources to create your own blog, podcast or video.

Feel free to add any other examples or resources in the comments.

EXTRA-ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVISTS USING SOCIAL WEB TOOLS

Beth Kanter raises $800 for the Sharing Foundation using the ChipIn widget plus her blog, social networks, Flickr and video in 26 days.

Darren Rowse celebrates ProBlogger's two year anniversary by raising $830 US ($100 AU) on his blog for Oxfam Australia with his Blogging for Chickens campaign.

Beth Kanter raises $50,000 for the Sharing Foundation using a Network for Good Badge and similar tools to the ChipIn campaign, in three weeks.

Chez Pim: raises almost $62,000 with her Menu for Hope Campaign in 2.5 weeks from the through her food blog and an online auction.

Green LA Girl and City Hippy raise awareness about Fair Trade coffee by launching the Starbucks Challenge in October 2005. Readers are asked to go to Starbucks and ask for a cup of fair trade coffee to see if Starbucks sticks with the policy advertised on their web site: They will French press a cup of Fair Trade coffee for anyone who asks for it. Readers were asked to write about what happened when they asked for Fair Trade coffee on their blog, or to email Green LA Girl or City Hippy. As of January 2006, more than 200 blogs had joined the challenge.

SDCLF (Sustainability Development for a Crowd-sourced Learning Framework – The Geospatial Case Study)

The key aim of the project is to explore how to harness and use crowd-sourcing techniques for long-term sustainability of learning materials for the geospatial sciences.  The landscape of geospatial science and the associated industry is changing rapidly with the advent and maturity of open source geospatial technologies.  Recent Government policy changes around the use and creation of open source documents and software, open standards and open data has reinforced this change.

The project focuses on improvement of content, introduction of interactivity and sustainability of the JISC funded E-Learning Framework for Using Geospatial Open Data, Open Source and Open Standards (ELOGeo). ELOGeo addresses the provision of an infrastructure for education, transfer of knowledge and training for users and researchers to facilitate the effective use of open geospatial services. It does this by providing a set of methodologies, tools and materials.

Announcing a New CCAPS Dashboard to Explore Climate Security Vulnerability in Africa

September 04, 2013

The Strauss Center’s Climate Change and African Political Stability (CCAPS) program today released the new CCAPS climate dashboard, an online platform that displays data on physical, socio-economic, demographic, and political insecurities to assess how these factors contribute to “climate security” vulnerability in Africa.

The CCAPS climate dashboard, built in partnership with Development Gateway, utilizes the CCAPS Climate Security Vulnerability Model to analyze where and how climate-related events could disrupt Africa’s security and development.

“The climate dashboard allows users to explore pressing climate security risks in a new hands-on way,” said CCAPS senior program manager Ashley Moran. “Leveraging the rigorous modeling of CCAPS researchers, the dashboard allows people to use the model to explore insecurities in Africa and to test their own beliefs about what drives vulnerability to climate change in Africa.”

The dashboard shows how the four sources of vulnerability used in the CCAPS model—physical exposure to climate-related hazards, population density, household and community resilience, and governance and political violence—contribute to local areas’ overall vulnerability to climate security concerns.

While the CCAPS model weights each source of vulnerability equally, the interactive features of the dashboard allow users to explore how changing these weights impact the overall understanding of vulnerability. In addition to reweighting the CCAPS climate security model, users can see how the model is built, learn more about how the model has been tested, and download maps produced by the CCAPS model.

“The CCAPS model offers a nuanced way to assess the security vulnerabilities associated with climate change in Africa and the potential intervention points to build resilience,” said LBJ School associate professor Joshua Busby whose team developed the CCAPS climate security vulnerability model. “We are excited about this new interactive platform that allows researchers and policymakers to engage with the model in a dynamic way.”

CCAPS partnered with Development Gateway to launch its award winning integrated mapping platform in early 2012 to analyze how climate, conflict, and aid intersect. CCAPS and Development Gateway have since produced data dashboards to provide in-depth examination of several thematic areas under study on the CCAPS program.

The Strauss Center’s CCAPS program analyzes the security implications of climate change in Africa, through funding from the U.S. Department of Defense’s Minerva Initiative.

System
an information system that provides communications, situational awareness, and visual analytics tools in a service-oriented architecture supporting web-based desktop and handheld device users. LEIF simplifies interfaces and visualizations of wellestablished visual analytic techniques to improve usability. Advanced analytics capability is maintained by enhancing the underlying processing to support the new interface. LEIF development is driven by real-world user feedback gathered through deployments at three operational law enforcement organizations in the U.S. The system incorporates a robust information ingest pipeline supporting a wide variety of information formats. LEIF also insulates interface and analytical components from information sources making it easier to adapt the framework for many different data repositories.

The conflux of two growing areas of technology – collaboration and visualization – into a new research direction, collaborative visualization, provides new research challenges. Technology now allows us to easily connect and collaborate with one another – in settings as diverse as over networked computers, across mobile devices, or using shared displays such as interactive walls and tabletop surfaces. Digital information is now regularly accessed by multiple people in order to share information, to view it together, to analyze it, or to form decisions. Visualizations are used to deal more effectively with large amounts of information while interactive visualizations allow users to explore the underlying data. While researchers face many challenges in collaboration and in visualization, the emergence of collaborative visualization poses additional challenges, but it is also an exciting opportunity to reach new audiences and applications for visualization tools and techniques.

The purpose of this article is (1) to provide a definition, clear scope, and overview of the evolving field of collaborative visualization, (2) to help pinpoint the unique focus of collaborative visualization with its specific aspects, challenges, and requirements within the intersection of general computer-supported cooperative work and visualization research, and (3) to draw attention to important future research questions to be addressed by the community. We conclude by discussing a research agenda for future work on collaborative visualization and urge for a new generation of visualization tools that are designed with collaboration in mind from their very inception.
Recent technological advances in connected-speech recognition and position sensing in space have encouraged the notion that voice and gesture inputs at the graphics interface can converge to provide a concerted, natural user modality. The work described herein involves the user commanding simple shapes about a large-screen graphics display surface. Because voice can be augmented with simultaneous pointing, the free usage of pronouns becomes possible, with a corresponding gain in naturalness and economy of expression. Conversely, gesture aided by voice gains precision in its power to reference.
Emerging open source Web/Mobile software coupled with new database technologies, open source hardware like wearables & AR/HUDs, and the increased prevalence of big data / open data can lower costs of visualization generation, lower barriers of entry to wider audience demographics, while increasing user engagement & heightening situational awareness. these factors give rise to possibilities for new forms communication and more efficient collaboration, becoming a more integral part of science, art, design & other interdisciplinary practices where logic & creativity collide.

Our goal is to encourage research, development, dialogue & education driving discovery of advanced, exploratory visualization tools depicting wider topological information cartographies that help researchers, journalists, artists & designers investigate & extract insight from large & diverse datasets comprised of highly varied statistics, code repos, 3D models, image/video/audio assets & other conent. We hope to drive creation of novel open‐source graphics applications, multi-modal interfaces & cross-platform experiences that blend high‐performance multidimensional visualization techniques and open source software/hardware & semantic Web technologies which easily cooperate with other applications, APIs, feeds & databased and to access remote, distributed content archives. These tools should support standards defined by the W3C and other standards bodies ensuring it easily integrates with the widest possible range of Web/mobile-based databases, code repositories & content formats. The tools should also contain examples and documentation describing technical details and features and specific use-cases.

Exploratory data analysis offers a set of graphical and statistical tools to find the full meaning from data sets.

The user visualizes analyzes and transforms data distributions with these tools. Graphs reveal relationships between variables; the residuals left after fitting data show the adequacy of the model.

Without this careful examination and understanding of the data row data analysis using standard statistical test can give misleading results. Exploratory data analysis has its own set of pitfalls and must be used with confirmatory statistics and studies. Increasing power resolution and personal computers enable modern statistical software to make these methods widely accessible. By easily moving between data and graphic representation, analysis & resulting insights can be comprehensive instead of tedious - providing fluid, inspired & unforeseen discoveries instead of rigid, dry & predetermined results. Exploratory data analysis can add an exciting and useful tool to the epidemiologic's repertoire.

Technology and embodiment: relationships and implications for knowledge, creativity and communication

Sara Price, George Roussos, Taciana Pontual Falcão, Jennifer G. Sheridan. London Knowledge Lab (May 2009)

Abstract

With the emergence of mobile and ubiquitous technologies there has been increased interest in exploring and thinking about the role of embodiment, and of particular relevance here, embodied cognition and embodied interaction. This interest has been accompanied by a rise in research that grounds ubiquitous technologies for learning in concepts of embodiment. New technologies provide the opportunity for interaction and learning to be more active, hands-on, directly related to physical contexts, new opportunities for communication and collaboration promoting socially mediated learning, and opportunities for new tools to be used as external cognitive support. Furthermore, graphical interfaces are extending the capability for more complex interactions, sense of presence and immersion that create a perception of embodiment in virtual environments. It is probably not surprising therefore that a central trend towards theorising about embodiment in both physical and virtual space is emerging, and a move towards understanding how mobile and ubiquitous technologies can enable new ‘spaces’ for learning experiences, that exploit embodied forms of interaction. In the context of education these themes are relatively new, the research spectrum is broad – running across formal and informal education, exploring new theories of learning (eg mobile learning), exploiting the continually developing technology – and to some extent limited in terms of understanding the relationship between technologies and embodiment for learning. However, drawing on literature and research examples, we can begin to see the current trends in the theoretical underpinning for embodied cognition and interaction, and to map out new directions of research exploring ubiquitous and mobile technologies for learning. Furthermore, we can begin to map current research findings and theoretical thinking to explore what this might mean for knowledge production, creativity and communication in education. This review is divided into three key sections (embodiment, the intersection with technology, and empirical research applications). At the end of each section we identify the key related opportunities, challenges, demands and risks with respect to education. These are then drawn together and discussed in terms of their implications for knowledge, creativity and communication in education.
The review begins by outlining current themes that form the theoretical underpinning of embodied cognition and embodied interaction. This provides the basis for mapping the ways in which ubiquitous and mobile technologies are being conceptualised in terms of interaction, and the directions of research with particular respect to learning contexts. The section begins by focussing on embodied cognition and draws on work from different research disciplines including philosophy, psychology, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and neuroscience. Here we outline the shifts in perspectives that have taken place within each of these disciplines to understand where current thinking and theorising about embodiment is seated. In so doing we see how concepts of embodiment have emerged, not just from one or two perspectives, but across a broad range of disciplines providing a powerful basis from which to think about society, technology and education, and compelling grounds for changes in the ways we think about, and enable, knowledge production, creativity and communication in education. Evidence from the different theoretical perspectives are presented within some overarching themes, which form the underpinning of theories of embodied cognition.
A further key concept to consider is ‘embodied interaction’ which centres around “the creation, manipulation and sharing of meaning through engaged interaction with artefacts” (Dourish, 2001). This concept has arisen in the context of tangible and social computing and draws on phenomenological philosophy, particularly the work of Heidegger and Wittgenstein. Tangible computing is based on tangible user interfaces where a person interacts with digital information through the physical environment. Social computing, on the other hand, describes the intersection of social behaviour and computational systems and is most often associated with online communities such as Facebook (facebook.com) and MySpace (myspace.com). Embodied interaction is not restricted to tangible and social computing, nor is it restricted to interaction in the physical world. As technologies move away from the desktops and into real world environments or even inside our bodies, increasingly we see new fields and ultimately new forms of embodied interaction emerging. The rise of graphical virtual spaces such as Second Life [secondlife.com] provide channels for exploring embodied interaction with or as an embodied agent – intelligent agents that interact with the environment through a physical or virtual body within that environment. Embodied interaction, then, is a mix of the virtual and physical, intangible and tangible, reality and fantasy, where new theories of embodied interaction pair the physical, digital and social interface with the human sensory system.
Section 3 presents an overview of the state of the art technologies, including key development trends, and their relationship with interaction and employment. The aim of this section is also to provide a brief introduction to the different technologies that form the foundations of research applications discussed in section 4. As embodied interaction with technologies is realised in many different ways a table is provided that outlines six “hot” technology topics, identifying where interaction occurs, the characteristics of each topic, and the particular focus of each topic. Then looking at each topic in more detail we consider the developing trends over the last three years in different technology fields, and how their underlying motivation can be traced to particular agendas. Again we use a table to illustrate these relationships, together with examples.
Section 4 focuses on interaction and learning based research around these technologies. This section is divided into 3 parts (i) Physical space: with technological innovations through embedded and ubiquitous computing bringing interaction closer to the so-called “real world” (Weiser et al, 1999), technology for learning is no longer only about the computer screen, but about physical action, physical objects, schools spaces and real world environments. This section explores how the different technologies have been used in research applications within learning contexts, illustrating their effect on learning activity, learning interaction and the relationship with embodiment (ii) Virtual space: developments in graphical virtual spaces have opened the door to more complex interactions in virtual worlds and computer gaming contexts. This section explores the concept of embodiment in virtual space in more detail, and discusses the role of virtual environments and computer games for learning contexts (iii) Intersection between physical and virtual space: finally we discuss the intersection between the two, or mixed reality, looking at interactive experiences which integrate physical and virtual spaces and discuss issues of not only transcending real-world boundaries, but also merging boundaries across physical and virtual space.
Finally, the discussion section draws together the themes presented, outlining the opportunities for embodiment in today’s climate of technology and society and its role in thinking about learning. Two future scenarios for technology-based learning are outlined along with the specific opportunities, challenges, demands and risks that they bring. Finally, the key implications for education in terms of challenges, demands and risks are discussed more specifically in terms of their implications for effectively supporting knowledge, creativity and communication in education.

1. Introduction

Embodiment in the context of this review centres around the notion that human reasoning and behaviour is defined by our physical and social experience and interaction with the world. Although concepts of embodiment are not new, current theoretical trends are placing more importance on the role of embodiment in understanding human behaviour. Several factors have contributed to this change, not least the emergence of technologies that enable radically different forms of interaction with them and through them, than traditional desktop computing. Ubiquitous computing technologies can be integrated into the environment, in unobtrusive and ’seamless’ ways. This offers opportunities to build on familiar real world ‘natural’ interaction practices through various forms of digital augmentation, eg enabling interaction with contextually coupled information. New technologies also provide opportunities for interaction and learning to be more active, hands-on, directly related to physical contexts, with new forms of communication and collaboration promoting socially mediated learning, and new tools that aid external cognitive support. Furthermore, graphical interface development extends possibilities for more complex interaction, sense of presence and immersion or embodiment in virtual environments, bringing new ’spaces’ for learning.

Psychologists and philosophers have long argued for the important role of sensori-motor interaction with the world for cognitive development (Piaget, 1972; Vygostsky, 1978; Clark and Chalmers, 1998), but with the growth of ubiquitous computing the possibility for enhancing physical environments and physical interaction have brought discussions around embodiment to the forefront, and driven forward research into understanding the interaction between mind, body and the environment. Collectively, these views and possibilities have wide-reaching implications for education, particularly in terms of the potential for influencing the way we teach and learn, and how education may be organised. At the heart of this it is important that we understand the underlying rationale for emergent theories of embodiment (embodied cognition, embodied interaction), how these intersect with technology development, the extent of research investigating the role and potential roles of ‘technology for embodiment’ in learning settings, and the potential implications for education.

This review begins by outlining the current theoretical underpinning of embodied cognition and embodied interaction, and the implications for knowledge, creativity and communication in education. We then present an overview of state of the art technologies, including key development trends, and their relationship with interaction and use, followed by a review of interaction and learning based research around these technologies, focusing on technologies embedded in physical learning spaces, virtual environments including gaming, and mixed reality. The discussion draws on this work to both theoretically and practically explore the potential impact of current trends and developments on shaping the future for education, highlighting the key opportunities, challenges and issues that emerge.

Embodied interaction in physical or virtual spaces allows us to explore neuro-engineering and notions of embodied intelligence. Current research is exploring how mind-body development shapes our perception, cognition, co-operation and social intelligence, the role of form and material properties in shaping behaviour, and designing for emergence (Pfeifer and Knoll, 2006). Pfeifer and Knoll’s view is that thought is not independent of body and that embodied intelligence has important implications in our understanding of both natural and artificial intelligence (2006).

At the heart of embodied interaction and technology is communication – we are less concerned with what innovative devices exist as how we use them as tools to stimulate thought and action. The inner workings of a mouse are invisible to the non-expert – what is important for the non-expert is what skills are required to use the mouse to perform particular actions. Technologies for embodied interaction, then, require an understanding of skill acquisition. Perhaps even more important, is how we interpret those skills, as the one performing or reflecting upon the embodied interaction.

2.3 Implications for knowledge, creativity and communication

Embodied cognition and interaction suggest that intelligence lies in the dynamic interaction of brains and the environment, and is centrally dependent on social and cultural worlds (Anderson, 2005). From this overview we can begin to identify some key implications for knowledge creativity and communication in education in the social, technical landscape of today. A key aspect is that sensori-motor experience and interaction with the environment are central to meaning making and conceptual understanding, and provides the basis for learning self-generation of goals and strategies for problem solving. Thus, it not only plays an important role in knowledge construction but also supports other kinds of knowledge such as learning strategy development. Another key aspect is evidence for the role of the external environment and external tools in supporting interaction in social contexts and cognition, especially with current technologies that provide more scope for communication and social interaction, and new ways of recording, collating, storing and re-representing information. The potential of mobile and ubiquitous technologies can also be mapped to other key features of embodiment, eg activities that exploit context-related learning, physical interaction and that are grounded in skilled, engaged practice, eg inquiry-based experiences.

3. Intersection with Technology

Embodied interaction with technologies is realised in many different ways. Table 1 outlines six “hot” topics:where interaction occurs, characteristics of each topic, and the particular focus of the topic. These topics and categories are not mutually exclusive – as technologies become cheaper, faster and more accessible they often slide between the various topics, interactions, characteristics and focus.

Ubiquitous Computing refers to information processing embedded into everyday artefacts and environments (Weiser, 1991). Ubicomp comprises a wide range of technologies including distributed networking, sensor networks, human-computer interaction and mobile computing (Weiser et al, 1999; Greenfield, 2006). Until recently, ubicomp was seen as the opposite of virtual reality – where interaction is placed inside a virtual world whilst ubicomp places interaction and computation in the ‘real world’. However, wireless computing, social networks and mixed-reality continue to redefine our understanding of embodied interaction and ubiquitous computing, and have the potential to push ‘traditional’ boundaries of where and how to distribute information, offering the capability to change learning environments and outcomes (Dourish, 2001; Rogers et al, 2006).

Proximity Interfaces Intra-body interfaces rely on proximity, using the human body as a transition medium to allow people to store, display, and exchange information (Zimmerman, 1996). They can act as social networking objects to exchange information about relationships, through common gestures such as a handshake (Kanis et al, 2004) or electronic wallets. This area is rapidly expanding as applications for mobile phones pair social networking information with physical location. For example, BrightKite (brightkite.com) and Twitter (twitter.com) allow social networking colleagues to see where each other are, meet up with others close by, or list interesting events in close proximity.

Wearable Interfaces are worn on the body, removable, and often considered extensions of the human body. Whilst pioneering applications such as the inverse surveillance system (Mann, 2001) or the early head-mounted displays worn by ‘cyborgs’ (MIT) seem more like science fiction, recent technology developments have led to mobile phones becoming the most ubiquitous wearable computer and are particularly well suited for mobile multitasking. For example, a wearable headset paired with a mobile phone allows users to drive a car whilst answering incoming phone calls. The fashion industry has taken a keen interest in wearable computing, (eg Joanna Berzowska (www.berzowska.com), and Maggie Orth (www.ifmachines.com) and the recent addition of DIY electronic kits such as the LilyPad Arduino board (www.arduino.cc) have introduced embodied interaction, and technology-based interactive fashion into the classroom.

Sensory-specific Interfaces focus on human senses as input. Olfactory interfaces focus on smell; haptic interfaces on touch; visual interfaces on vision. The least explored area is olfactory interfaces with its realisation only just becoming available in applications such as fire fighting and surgical training. Sensory specific interfaces are often multimodal – haptic and tangible interfaces are often paired with sound and vision.

Implantable Interfaces Implantable interfaces are fixed inside a body, but because of associated health risks they have long been the domain of medical research and healthcare applications, and often focus on enabling greater accessibility among disabled and challenged patients. However, performance artists are also exploring interaction with implantable interfaces and the ethical and cultural issues and long-term effects associated with extreme surgical intervention, eg Orlan (www.orlan.net), Stelarc (www.stelarc.va.com.au), Eduardo Kac (www.ekac.org), as well as cybernetics researchers such as Kevin Warwick (www.kevinwarwick.com).

Looking in more detail at developments in the past three years, Table 2 outlines the current trends and the biggest movers. Important to note is that all of these fields are motivated by particular agendas, eg a software computing company, which sponsors a conference, will tend to select papers, which relate to their technology.

3.1 Implications for knowledge, creativity and communication

Mobility In 2008, technology is all about mobility and connectedness. Increasingly technologies are moving from the labs into real-world spaces such as the home, outdoor environments and even nightclubs and festivals (Sheridan et al, 2004). As mobile and smart phones provide more on-demand services and options “cloud computing” will emerge, ie people only ‘take what they need’ whilst being mobile, and leave everything else at work/home/virtual repository. Furthermore, assuming that learning is not restricted to classrooms, increasingly connected mobile devices and similarly connected augmented environments would help bridge gaps between learning contexts, and contribute to the construction of general knowledge.

Multimodality and multi-tasking Following on from this, people will want to do more things simultaneously. Multimodality and multitask devices provide new means for expressing creativity, in an increasingly fast and demanding society. However, current trends indicate that people want devices and applications that are specific to their immediate needs rather than generalised across devices and applications.

Connectedness and collaboration in the real world Associated with mobility and constant access to information, the social interaction provided by the increasing connectivity within communities (and the environments) potentially leads to more collaboration, as communication becomes easier and ubiquitous.

Context-based Ubiquitous, wearable and mobile technologies provide capabilities for bringing new concepts of authenticity to learning environments, by, eg augmenting real-world contexts, like museums, field trips; augmenting physical role play; and augmenting real-world spaces with virtual overlays of authentic contexts for learning.

Convergence versus divergence Applications beyond time and space (always on, anywhere) versus tailoring to individual and immediate need (only on now, just here).

4. Technology-based learning research

4.1 Physical space

Biological and psychological aspects of learning have been acknowledged since the 18th century (Jean-Jacques Rousseau) when the use of games, manual works and direct experience, moved learning away from purely memorizing rules and procedures. Hands-on learning has been advocated (Pestalozzi, 1803), implemented in kindergartens (by Froebel in 1837), and largely adopted in schools worldwide (Daltoé and Strelow, 2005), through the use of simple materials and manipulatives like Cuisinaire rods (Fig. 1A) (fractions and proportions), golden blocks (Fig. 1B) (decimal system) amongst others, to stimulate children to express themselves through perceptual-motor activities, and language and play (Colella, 2000).

(B) Golden blocks

Fig. 1 – traditional manipulatives

In the 1980s, computers became popular tools in schools, providing diverse transformative experiences for children’s development (Papert, 1980). However, with traditional computers, interaction is screen-based, restricted to mouse and keyboard input devices, thus lacking the advantages of concreteness, physicality, and connection with real-world environments. Recent technological innovations through embedded and ubiquitous computing bring technology-based interaction closer to the so-called “real world” (Weiser et al, 1999), providing new learning experiences that rekindle opportunities for learning through physical activity, engagement with physical objects and real world environments (Eisenberg, 2003; Moher et al, 2008).

4.1.1 Physical interaction

Mobile and sensor based technologies have been used to link physical activity to conceptual ideas, through mapping physical activity to visual or audio representations of abstract concepts, thus encouraging combined physical and cognitive development. Smartstep and Floormat (Scarlatos et al, 1999) used sensor-embedded floor mats to link children’s physical movement (eg walking up and down the mats) with screen-based visual representations of mathematical concepts (eg discrete number line). The mapping of physical action to abstract concepts was thought to “make the activity more meaningful for the child … partly because the physical objects help children to see – and therefore better understand – abstract concepts in a new way” (Scarlatos, 2006, p295). More recently configuration of Wii controllers is being used to support applications where physical activity is promoted through digital augmentation. Kahol and Smith (2008) showed that a Wii game (Marble Mania) designed to support movements required for performing surgery, increased surgical dexterity skills. Applications using a Wii remote to measure acceleration of a swinging pendulum, and forces involved in freefall, by transmitting acceleration data in real-time (Vannoni and Straulino, (2007) have also been developed to teach force, velocity and acceleration. More recently, investigations into mapping physical activity with such physics concepts (motion and acceleration) will provide new insights into the value of embodied interaction in learning (Sheridan et al, 2009).

4.1.2 Interacting with physical objects

Similarly tangibles are used to combine the benefits of concrete manipulation with digital technologies to enhance interaction experiences. Tangibles are digitally augmented objects used as input devices to trigger digital effects on a display surface (O’Malley and Fraser, 2004). Tangibles are thought to be beneficial for learning due to the opportunity to exploit their familiarity of interaction; flexible linking to different forms of representation; their affordances for constructive activity; and opportunities for new forms of collaborative interaction.

Several popular (and therefore familiar) toys have been transformed into technological artefacts, eg Bitball (a transparent sphere that records and transmits information about its own movement (Resnick, 1998)); assembling blocks that involve concepts of behaviour patterns (Stackables, Programmable Beads (Resnick et al, 1998)); and system dynamics (FlowBlocks and SystemBlocks (Resnick et al, 1998; Zuckerman et al, 2005)); and blocks that are used as tangible programming elements (Wyeth and Purchase, 2002; Schweikardt and Gross, 2008) to make programming easy and engaging for children.

Other kinds of assembly or constructive kits allow children to build their own, personalized models, stimulating their creativity and imagination. For example, Topobo (Raffle et al, 2004) enables children to build creatures out of digitally embedded pieces, which can record and playback physical motion. Research suggests that this process of creating models helps develop a greater understanding about the functioning of things (Klopfer et al, 2002). Children produce knowledge by expressing themselves through the representations they create (Marshall et al, 2003), ie the artefact embodies the children’s activity and thoughts.

While familiarity may engage children, ambiguous or less familiar representations can promote curiosity and exploration (Rogers et al, 2002). With Chromarium, a system to explore colour mixing through physical and digital tools, children experimented and reflected more with less familiar representations. In this case, children investigated the properties of a model built by someone else (Marshall et al, 2003). Knowledge is produced through exploration (leading to conclusions), rather than expressivity, and therefore there is less space for creativity, suggesting expressive and exploratory systems lend themselves to different contexts.

Tangible environments also lend themselves to collaborative work, as usually a set of interaction objects can be manipulated both by a group and individually. Combining tangibles with tabletops (Reactable (Jordà, 2003), Sensetable (Patten et al, 2001)) increases collaboration by adding the advantages of concrete manipulation to shareable interfaces that encourage communication, providing face-to-face interaction and multiple, simultaneous users. Recent work suggests how the interactive properties of such shared interfaces supports productive collaborative knowledge building (Pontual Falcao and Price, under review).

4.1.3 Interacting across physical spaces

Technology distributed across physical environments can be used to create collaborative dynamic simulations, which take advantage of whole physical spaces, like classrooms. This typically includes the use of mobile devices, as a way of freely exploring the environments (Klopfer et al, 2002), and embodying meaning-making in activity contexts (Rogers and Price, 2009). Participatory simulations enable students to act as embodied participants (Moher, 2006), as the systems are layered on top of the real world. Instead of watching a screen, students interact with technology distributed across the environment and become part of the simulation, while abstract concepts turn into experience (Colella, 2000). Such simulations might be seen as large-scale microworlds, as they present scenarios (with context-based information (Klopfer et al, 2002)) mediated by rules and open to knowledge production through investigation and experimentation (Colella, 2000). For example, in the environmental detectives system (Klopfer et al, 2002) students investigate ecological issues using portable computers; in a virus activity participants explore the spread of disease, by collecting information and communicating through wearable computers (Colella, 2000); in the Ambient Wood (Rogers et al, 2002) children discover complex ecology processes whie exploring a digitally enhanced woodland; in Savannah (Facer, 2004) children work in teams to learn about animal behaviour and longer term survival, using handheld computers that map the virtual environment to the school playing field; and in Frequency 1550 mobile phones are used to “transport” children into the past allowing them to explore previous societies (Huizenga et al, 2007). Many of these experiences also engage students in forms of inquiry learning, with the facility to collate diverse sources of data that can be re-represented in the classroom, often using integrated visualisations.

While virtual simulations can overcome and ignore human limitations, the constraints of the human body are naturally taken into account in these systems through “authentic physicality” (Moher et al, 2008). This represents a shift in the concept of direct interaction, which in the past referred to manipulating agents or parameters through an interface or virtual world. ‘Embedded phenomena’ is a technology instantiation where scientific phenomena are mapped to classroom physical space (Moher, 2006). Local and partial information about the state of the system is distributed through media across the classroom in a persistent manner, to be monitored and manipulated by students throughout an extended period of time (weeks). Several embedded phenomena systems have been developed and tested in classrooms (RoomBugs, HelioRoom, RoomQuake (Moher, 2006)). The Wallcology environment (Moher et al, 2008) expands this framework by enabling distributed collaboration, increasing physicality and expanding the activity sites. The embedded phenomena framework uses ambient media to support embodied interaction, and draws on situated learning and psychology theories that support action as the origin of thought and bodily interactions with the world as the base of cognition (Moher, 2006).

4.2 Virtual space

Embodiment forms a key theme within virtual worlds and computer gaming, where immersion in the activity is considered central for learning (Gee, 2007). Learning content is embedded in the experience, so that meaning making and knowledge construction take place within an appropriate context, rather than a series of facts removed from the activity. Virtual worlds, like physical worlds, are based on the senses, where vision, touch, and hearing are supposed to function, and are, therefore, perceived in similar ways to the physical world (Biocca, 1997). In contrast Egoyan (2007) describes the concept of embodiment in virtual worlds as performance rather than as sensation. Through performative experience, changes in our understanding of emotion, actions and behaviours can take place. Important components for interacting in virtual spaces include creativity (constructing identity), communication (the ability to express through an avatar) and performance, but all are bounded by the constraints of the tools available and the design of the game. For example, design may cause release from embodiment through anomalies with the real world, eg walking through walls. This release from embodiment may, in fact, be a seam around which learning may be mediated – through encouraging different levels of engagement and reflection (Ackerman, 1996).

4.2.1 Creativity

Avatars form the physical instantiation of self to act and interact in a virtual space, which is often made ‘real’ through objects, spaces, properties and behaviours. Through avatars users create an identity, with physical, social and behavioural attributes of their choice, eg Second Life, MySpace. On one hand this offers opportunities to explore and experiment with the nature of self and identity, and concepts that are difficult in the physical world (Egoyan, 2007) eg relationships, views and behaviours, where interactions with others actually takes place. On the other hand, through avatars people have a tendency to represent their concept of ‘me’ (although this may change over time) and often express whether they feel ‘comfortable’ or not in their ‘virtual skin’ and strive to feel ‘right’ (Taylor, 2002).

4.2.2 Performance

Although the development of performances in virtual environments such as Second Life are relatively new, they promise exciting possibilities for challenging the way we communicate with each other, perceive our bodies and our relationship to space. Since performance is a reflexive activity, through performance in virtual space we can “reveal ourselves to ourselves” (Turner, 1986, p81). Virtual environments also provide a space for mediating interaction between performers and audience through improvisation and construction of alternative narratives. This not only reveals theoretical possibilities for embodied interaction but also new technical possibilities. New software for creating different identities, for chatting between participants, or even game controllers (such at the Nintendo Wii Remote) challenges how we act with our physical bodies in virtual space.

Performance in general is fundamentally about making things seem real when they are not (Morse, 1998) and much of this theory can be applied to our understanding of embodied interaction in virtual space. For example, emerging avatar performance companies such as Second Front (the first performance art group in Second Life), use performance theory to explore of virtual embodiment, online performance and formation of virtual narrative (slfront.blogspot.com).

Performance, and in particular performance art, has a unique role to play in education. Garoian (1999) claims that performance art is both pedagogical and post-modern. He suggests that a collapsing of the difference between academic and creative work would promote critical thinking in any discipline and that performance art pedagogy represents the “embodied expression of culture as aesthetic experience – that is pedagogy as performance art and performance art as pedagogy”

4.2.3 Communication

Communication is a key component to attaining a sense of presence, which is grounded in both the physical activity of the avatar and social practice. The concept of boundaries, in a physical and social sense, are examples of embodiment and presence, eg the sense of someone else (through the avatars) being in ‘your’ space. Furthermore, “much as in offline life [...] digital bodies are used in a variety of ways – to greet, to play, to signal group affiliation, to convey opinions or feelings, and to create closeness.” (Taylor, 2002, p.41). Virtual avatars can also generate an aura of societies in which there are no boundaries between e.g. cultures, religion. At a different level of interaction, virtual worlds can create a space for inhabiting worlds devoid of these kinds of boundaries, and provide a space where people get to choose how to communicate and how to play out their world in ways that are different from the real world (McIlveny, 1999).

Researchers are seeking to understand factors that trigger high levels of motivation, and activities within ‘gaming’ settings that might contribute to learning. Prensky (2007) goes beyond this, suggesting that the physical structure of brains is different for those growing up in a digital world (cf: Luria 1979 – environment and culture affects the way we think; different cultures think differently), and that there is a different blend of cognitive skills that is a product of exposure to multiple digital media. However, the need for interactivity, immediate feedback and response, to maintain attention is highlighted, together with the concern that this is coupled with less time and opportunity for reflection (Prensky, 2001). One focus of gaming research, rather than advocating games per se for learning, is to take lessons learned in terms of learning principles that can be found in game culture.

Gee (2007) outlines 15 features of video games that form the basis for good learning. Some key features that are useful to consider in the context of this review include (i) Identity (for real learning the learner needs to make a commitment through identity in games) and customisation (the ability for the player to choose roles that suit them) are both concerned with self and preference. This raises issues of whether it is educationally important or not to encourage students to take on unfamiliar roles or to do the things they find harder (ii) Risk taking: (offering the opportunity for positive failure and therefore encouraging risk taking, and which maps well to current thinking about the value of exploratory learning) and well ordered problems (the need to order problems so that they always build on ones solved earlier, thus avoiding the issue of exploratory learning where creative solutions may be found, but don’t lead to good learning about how to solve later problems (see Elman, 1991)) suggest the complexity of integrating good learning practice into education (iii) Challenge and consolidation (games follow a ‘cycle of expertise’ – ie get a set of challenging problems which are solved many times until routinised and then more problems given) suggest similar strategies used in some traditional teaching in school, suggesting evidence of a good strategy worth continuing (iv) Performance before competence (offering the facility to perform before you need to be competent) is akin to exploring, discovering, an underlying ethos to a number of learning experiences with mobile and ubiquitous technologies.

4.3 Intersection between physical and virtual space

Mixed reality, also known as ‘augmented reality’, describes the intersection of the real and virtual – where interaction in the real world with physical objects effects interaction in the virtual world with virtual objects and characters (and vice versa). With the introduction of smaller, cheaper and mobile technologies, mixed reality opens the possibility for new kinds of embodied interaction in educational settings. Mixed reality in teaching environments provides opportunities to explore embodied interaction through self and remote learning. The MiTRLE project is a mixed reality teaching environment, which pairs local students with remote students through a virtual world in a higher education setting. The aim is to foster a sense of community amongst remote students on the basis that avatar representations of teachers and students will help create a sense of shared presence, engendering a sense of community and improving student engagement in online lessons (Gardner et al, 2008).

Mixed reality environments also have real-world implications. Geo-networking merges information from social networking sites with real-world physical locations. Live Geo Social Networking applications such as Twitter merge this information in real-time so that participants can post and search geo coordinates of time critical items. For example, a person can use a mobile phone to post information about an event they are witnessing in real time and all other interested parties in the vicinity can search, see and get directions to the event. These applications could have wide reaching implications for remote and collaborative self-learning in mixed reality settings although attention needs to be paid to the risks involved in sharing such information.

5. Discussion

Technology-based applications can create new kinds of learning spaces – both physical and virtual, that bring opportunities to exploit the value of embodiment for learning and interaction. Assuming that learning content is embedded in experience and knowledge production should take place in appropriate contexts, immersion in learning activities is also fundamental. Technology interfaces presented in this review can support engagement in directly active and participative ways, for example, through physical activity and experience in authentic contexts, exploration, discovery and experimentation, use of new external tools that can mediate action and thought, collaboration and communication (including that which occurs through forms of expression), creativity through expression and production, learning activities and situations that provide new catalysts for reflection and discussion around learning domain, and inclusion of students with physical disabilities and/or learning difficulties through multimodality and collaboration. Collaborative and communicative activity changes offering new forms of interaction and activity including sharing of information, eg embedded phenomena, transferring of data through physical proximity, eg participatory simulations, and expressions of knowledge or creations through production, eg virtual worlds, MySpace, re-representations of collated data, eg Ambient Wood/ Savannah; and expression or communication through performance activities, eg avatar performance art groups like Second Front. In addition, different relationships between student and teacher (eg as facilitator/guide) can be promoted, which maps to the emerging prominence of independent learning in the current (science) curriculum (Lombardi, 2007). At the same time this raises issues about students’ competence at taking on a more independent self-generated activity or role that this demands, and teachers’ ability or familiarity with facilitating learning.

However, such opportunities also raise a number of issues and challenges for education. Here we provide two scenarios derived from ideas raised earlier to identify and discuss the key opportunities, challenges, risks and demands that emerge within the context of embodiment, technology and education. With each scenario we identify some specifically related opportunities and issues, and then discuss the general risks, challenges and demands that such scenarios might bring.

5.1 Scenario 1: Embedded experiences

Opportunities Features of mobility and sensor embedding technologies provide new opportunities to re-think space, place and classroom organisation. Applications like the ‘embedded phenomena’ engage large groups of children in science learning in radically different ways within a classroom setting. The ‘persistent’ concept in this model of augmented learning, where the phenomena run over weeks or months, and where the activity is related to but asynchronous with the regular flow of instruction in the classroom, illustrates new openings for rethinking models of instruction and classroom practice (Price, 2007). In ‘embedded’ experiences, students are repeatedly exposed to different pieces of information distributed across the physical space of the classroom, and given opportunities for role-play, providing them with experiences from different perspectives and the means to build a collective and comprehensive understanding. Research has illustrated how this might work in science learning, but we could also imagine structuring history and geography learning in similar ways. Imagine learning a time period in history or geographical changes (climate or landscape changes) where events over time are experienced within the classroom across a several week period. In history this might follow a series of pertinent events from the start to the end of a world war. In geography this might illustrate the formation of the ice age with speeded up time events and examples of the changes taking place on the land and the people living there. Students could be alerted to particular events taking place at appropriate points in time and access video showing events, take environmental measurements that demonstrate the climate change, or even have opportunities to take part in political debates at pertinent times as historical events unfold. Such interaction promotes extended exposure to a topic, enabling reflection over time, but furthermore provides new opportunities for students to experience and understand causal events over time.

5.2 Scenario 2: Shareable interfaces

Boundaries between physical and social spaces, and between different kinds of knowledge or learning contexts (informal/formal) are also changing, offering opportunities for ways to integrate everyday experience and interaction for learning. Mobile technologies offer opportunities to extend learning beyond the classroom, bridging the gap between home and school, and between field-work and classroom. Mobile phones and other multi-functional handheld or personal devices can be carried around, enable access to, recording of and communication of various forms of information and data, including photos, video, scientific measurements, survey records. Such tasks are freed from the classroom and can become living experiences, enabling learning to be more embedded in students’ own experiences and real-world topics of relevance. Both horizontal and vertical surfaces can be used in the classroom to display data uploaded from the different sources, which can then be used for sharing, explanation and discussion in classroom settings. Flexible use of large displays could exploit both small group and large class interaction. For example, table-tops are particularly suitable for small group interaction, but can also be combined with large displays to provide a forum for sharing student information with a broader audience. Such table-top interaction also provides opportunities for student expression, explanation and demonstration.

6. Conclusion

Taking into account evidence and theories arising from embodied cognition and interaction, developments in computing technologies, and evidence from research, the future for education is set to change. Paying attention to and integrating up-to-date technology into education is of paramount importance, as it inevitably forms a central part of everyday life, but much work is yet to be done to establish effective ways of using these technologies to promote learning – both in formal and informal contexts. Of emerging significance are the potential changes in learning activity and learning process that are precipitated through technologies. Ubiquitous learning experiences demand different kinds of endeavours and activity than (some) traditional learning activities. We can see how ubiquitous learning environments (both physical and virtual) can provide ’spaces’ within which learners can explore, discover, experience concepts/ideas, and which can serve as a discussion forum, eg getting students to think about different issues and different boundaries. Inherent in this process is the re-thinking of what education means for developing learners; what are the central components of learning and the kinds of skills that learners will need to acquire to engage fruitfully in adult society and life. This requires not only understanding the underlying drivers for learning, but also the implications for teachers (their role, practice and training) and the development of curriculum and educational establishments. Research effort and evidence is needed exploring effective ways for teachers to know how to use and adopt technologies.

From Memory Arts to the New Code Paradigm: The Artist as Engineer of Virtual Information Space and Virtual Experience
This paper examines contemporary developments in the creation and experience of immersive 3D art projects in the context of spatial and information design. It takes into consideration historic forebears, particularly the ancient Greek art of memory, contemporary theorists, and current new media artists who are pushing code and application design to new limits. The essay specifically addresses the role of the artist as "coder" and application engineer and anticipates concerns and possible technological developments in data visualization and virtual spaces. As new media artists write their own code, current boundaries between disciplines and sectors become blurred and new aesthetic judgments become pivotal. Additionally, current management and organizational structures are challenged to confront a world that increasingly visualizes and communicates in 3D.

Scientific visualization has the potential to make science education more accessible and to provide a means for authentic scientific inquiry. The role of scientific visualization within science is explicated through examples of its use and by presenting a sociological account of science that portrays scientific visualization as an important new inscriptional system. Three examples of using scientific visualization within education are provided: the ChemViz Project at the National Center for Supercomputing Activities, the Image Processing for Teaching (IPT) project at the University of Arizona, and an undergraduate climatology course at the University of Chicago. Potential problems of integrating scientific visualization within secondary education are described, including students' need to learn basic scientific practices, incompatibilities between the format of the traditional high-school classroom and scientific inquiry, and the need for additional infrastructure within schools. Finally, possible solutions to these problems are described, culminating in a view of scientific visualization as a means to provide education with an important new inscriptional system for exploratory, inquiry-driven learning and to link the aims of education to the practices of science.

This article describes constructing interactive and dynamic linked data views using the Java programming language. The data views are designed for data that have a multivariate component. The approach to displaying data comes from earlier research on building statistical graphics based on data pipelines, in which different aspects of data processing and graphical rendering are organized conceptually into segments of a pipeline. The software design takes advantage of the object-oriented nature of the Java language to open up the data pipeline, allowing developers to have greater control over their visualization applications. Importantly, new types of data views coded to adhere to a few simple design requirements can easily be integrated with existing pipe sections. This allows access to sophisticated linking and dynamic interaction across all (new and existing) view types. Pipe segments can be accessed from data analysis packages such as Omegahat or R, providing a tight coupling of visual and numerical methods.

XGobi is a data visualization system with state-of-the-art interactive and dynamic methods for the manipulation of views of data. It implements 2-D displays of projections of points and lines in high-dimensional spaces, as well as parallel coordinate displays and textual views thereof. Projection tools include dotplots of single variables, plots of pairs of variables, 3-D data rotations, various grand tours, and interactive projection pursuit. Views of the data can be reshaped. Points can be labeled and brushed with glyphs and colors. Lines can be edited and colored. Several XGobi processes can be run simultaneously and linked for labeling, brushing, and sharing of projections. Missing data are accommodated and their patterns can be examined; multiple imputations can be given to XGobi for rapid visual diagnostics. XGobi includes an extensive online help facility. XGobi can be integrated in other software systems, as has been done for the data analysis language S, the geographic information system (GIS) ArcView™, and the interactive multidimensional scaling program XGvis. XGobi is implemented in the X Window System™ for portability as well as the ability to run across a network.

Correlation and covariance matrices provide the basis for all classical multivariate techniques. Many statistical tools exist for analyzing their structure but, surprisingly, there are few techniques for exploratory visual display, and for depicting the patterns of relations among variables in such matrices directly, particularly when the number of variables is moderately large. This article describes a set of techniques we subsume under the name "corrgram," based on two main schemes: (a) Rendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude. We consider some of the properties of several iconic representations, in relation to the kind of task to be performed. (b) Reordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that "similar" variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception. In addition, the extension of this visualization to matrices for conditional independence and partial independence is described and illustrated, and we provide an easily used SAS implementation of these methods.

An exponentially growing volume of digital information makes extraction of relevant items increasingly difficult. This article documents the adoption of information visualization tools by researchers in the disciplines of geography, computer science, and information science to facilitate exploration of very large data archives. Graphic depiction of database content (or the database "semantics") can be based on a spatial or even a geographic metaphor. Such depictions, often called information spaces or information worlds, provide one example of "spatialization." Various forms of spatialized views are critiqued in this article. To date, systematic approaches to the creation of spatialized views have lacked solid theoretical foundations. Three spatial frames of reference are presented to formalize and visualize semantic spatialized views: geographic space, cognitive space, and Benediktine space. Application to an example of a very large online catalog (GEOREF) highlights the underlying assumptions of the space types and demonstrates what spatial properties are preserved for each proposed approach.

Increased interest in longitudinal social networks and the recognition that visualization fosters theoretical insight create a need for dynamic network visualizations, or network “movies.” This article confronts theoretical questions surrounding the temporal representations of social networks and technical questions about how best to link network change to changes in the graphical representation. The authors divide network movies into (1) static flip books, where node position remains constant but edges cumulate over time, and (2) dynamic movies, where nodes move as a function of changes in relations. Flip books are particularly useful in contexts where relations are sparse. For more connected networks, movies are often more appropriate. Three empirical examples demonstrate the advantages of different movie styles. A new software program for creating network movies is discussed in the appendix.

"Exploratory" and "confirmatory" data analysis can both be viewed as methods for comparing observed data to what would be obtained under an implicit or explicit statistical model. For example, many of Tukey's methods can be interpreted as checks against hypothetical linear models and Poisson distributions. In more complex situations, Bayesian methods can be useful for constructing reference distributions for various plots that are useful in exploratory data analysis. This article proposes an approach to unify exploratory data analysis with more formal statistical methods based on probability models. These ideas are developed in the context of examples from fields including psychology, medicine, and social science.

Learning to make music enhances spatial reasoning.

We explored the use of multidimensional scaling (MDS) of tree-to-tree pairwise distances to visualize the relationships among sets of phylogenetic trees. We found the technique to be useful for exploring "tree islands" (sets of topologically related trees among larger sets of near-optimal trees), for comparing sets of trees obtained from bootstrapping and Bayesian sampling, for comparing trees obtained from the analysis of several different genes, and for comparing multiple Bayesian analyses. The technique was also useful as a teaching aid for illustrating the progress of a Bayesian analysis and as an exploratory tool for examining large sets of phylogenetic trees. We also identified some limitations to the method, including distortions of the multidimensional tree space into two dimensions through the MDS technique, and the definition of the MDS-defined space based on a limited sample of trees. Nonetheless, the technique is a useful approach for the analysis of large sets of phylogenetic trees.

Modern sensor technologies, especially in biomedicine, produce increasingly detailed and informative image ensembles, many extremely complex. It will be argued that pattern theory can supply mathematical representations of subject-matter knowledge that can be used as a basis for algorithmic `understanding' of such pictures. After a brief survey of the basic principles of pattern theory we shall illustrate them by an application to a concrete situation: high magnification (greater than 15 000 ×) electron micrographs of cardiac muscle cells. The aim is to build algorithms for automatic hypothesis formation concerning the number, location, orientation and shape of mitochondria and membranes. For this we construct a pattern theoretic model in the form of a prior probability measure on the space of configurations describing these hypotheses. This measure is synthesized by solving sequentially a jump-diffusion equation of generalized Langevin form. The jumps occur for the creation-annihilation of hypotheses, corresponding to a jump from one continuum to another in configuration (hypothesis) space. These continua (subhypotheses) are expressed in terms of products of low dimensional Lie groups acting on the generators of a template. We use a modified Bayes approach to obtain the hypothesis formation, also organized by solving a generalized Langevin equation. To justify this it is shown that the resulting jump-diffusion process is ergodic so that the solution converges to the desired probability measure. To speed up the convergence we reduce the computation of the drift term in the stochastic differential equation analytically to a curvilinear integral, with the random term computed almost instantaneously. The algorithms thus obtained are implemented, both for mitochondria and membranes, on a 4000 processor parallel machine. Photographs of the graphics illustrate how automatic hypothesis formation is achieved. This approach is applied to deformable neuroanatomical atlases and tracking recognition from narrow band and high resolution sensor arrays.
We propose a rudimentary taxonomy of interactive data visualization based on a triad of data analytic tasks: finding Gestalt, posing queries, and making comparisons. These tasks are supported by three classes of interactive view manipulations: focusing, linking, and arranging views. This discussion extends earlier work on the principles of focusing and linking and sets them on a firmer base. Next, we give a high-level introduction to a particular system for multivariate data visualization--XGobi. This introduction is not comprehensive but emphasizes XGobi tools that are examples of focusing, linking, and arranging views; namely, high-dimensional projections, linked scatterplot brushing, and matrices of conditional plots. Finally, in a series of case studies in data visualization, we show the powers and limitations of particular focusing, linking, and arranging tools. The discussion is dominated by high-dimensional projections that form an extremely well-developed part of XGobi. Of particular interest are the illustration of asymptotic normality of high-dimensional projections (a theorem of Diaconis and Freedman), the use of high-dimensional cubes for visualizing factorial experiments, and a method for interactively generating matrices of conditional plots with high-dimensional projections. Although there is a unifying theme to this article, each section--in particular the case studies--can be read separately.

An important goal of visualization technology is to support the exploration and analysis of very large amounts of data. This article describes a set of pixel-oriented visualization techniques that use each pixel of the display to visualize one data value and therefore allow the visualization of the largest amount of data possible. Most of the techniques have been specifically designed for visualizing and querying large data bases. The techniques may be divided into query-independent techniques that directly visualize the data (or a certain portion of it) and query-dependent techniques that visualize the data in the context of a specific query. Examples for the class of query-independent techniques are the screen-filling curve and recursive pattern techniques. The screen-filling curve techniques are based on the well-known Morton and Peano-Hilbert curve algorithms, and the recursive pattern technique is based on a generic recursive scheme, which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for visualizing large data sets. Examples for the class of query-dependent techniques are the snake-spiral and snake-axes techniques, which visualize the distances with respect to a data base query and arrange the most relevant data items in the center of the display. In addition to describing the basic ideas of our techniques, we provide example visualizations generated by the various techniques, which demonstrate the usefulness of our techniques and show some of their advantages and disadvantages.

By using harmonic radar, we report the complete flight paths of displaced bees. Test bees forage at a feeder or are recruited by a waggle dance indicating the feeder. The flights are recorded after the bees are captured when leaving the hive or the feeder and are released at an unexpected release site. A sequence of behavioral routines become apparent: (i) initial straight flights in which they fly the course that they were on when captured (foraging bees) or that they learned during dance communication (recruited bees); (ii) slow search flights with frequent changes of direction in which they attempt to "get their bearings"; and (iii) straight and rapid flights directed either to the hive or first to the feeding station and then to the hive. These straight homing flights start at locations all around the hive and at distances far out of the visual catchment area around the hive or the feeding station. Two essential criteria of a map-like spatial memory are met by these results: bees can set course at any arbitrary location in their familiar area, and they can choose between at least two goals. This finding suggests a rich, map-like organization of spatial memory in navigating honey bees.

Sociomapping is a method used for data analysis and visualization. It uses the data-landscape metaphor by creating a visually coded picture resembling a map, which can be interpreted with similar rules as landscape navigation. This picture is called a Sociomap.

We are introducing a new revolutionary tool for visualization and analysis of data. Sociomaps (a result of Sociomapping analysis) are complex graphs that resemble a landscape. Your abilities to move in space, for which you are trained from early childhood, will help you to interpret the complex relationships encoded in Sociomap. Sociomap enables to visualize, explore and analyze the structure and dynamics of a system and to present it in a way, which is easy to understand, especially for the public and non-scientific audience.

Sociomapping is based on the theory of fuzzy sets, mathematical topology and pattern recognition. The method of Sociomapping was developed by Dr. Radvan Bahbouh, founder of QED GROUP, in 1993, originally as a tool for the prediction of group dynamics

embodiment and Digital Technology in Education, outlining key theoretical approaches to embodiment, and their role in thinking about education/ learning with emergent digital technologies.

Researching Embodiment with Digital Technologies

Emergent digital technologies, such as mobile, tangible, sensor and haptic based interfaces, offer a different perspective and approach to interaction. Their very nature offers opportunities for exploiting a wider range of perceptual experiences than traditional desktop computing. In particular, they offer opportunities to exploit bodily-based physical experiences in new ways, for example, through manipulation of physical objects linked to a variety of digitally augmentations; enhancing contextually based experience in real world environments; and promoting novel kinaesthetic experiences, thereby fostering new forms of interaction and new ways of thinking. Such digital environments are inherently multi-modal, requiring a methodological approach that takes multiple modalities into consideration. This project will investigate the role of emergent technologies in engendering ‘embodied’ learning experiences, specifically looking at ways in which they give rise to science learning experiences that are ‘embodied’; ways in which such ‘embodied learning experiences’ can foster scientific understanding and reasoning. In so doing the project aims to further develop notions of what ‘embodied learning’ means in the context of digital technologies, and to better understand the role of multiple modes of representation in communication and meaning making.

In Being and Time Heidegger made the distinction between tools that are ‘present-at-hand’ and ‘ready-to-hand’. Tools that are ‘ready-to-hand’ can be used without thinking, without awareness. Although familiarity usually leads to tools becoming ‘ready-to-hand’, our awareness of them may be drawn back to them if they suddenly stop working (Heidegger uses the example of the pen that breaks while you are writing).

“Culturomics” is the application of massive scale data collection and analysis to the study of human culture.
our historical record is being digitized, stored & tracked & dissected

We’re a team of visual analytics researchers who love making big, complex data useful through great visual design, compelling interaction, support for sound analytic methods, and solid engineering. We invent new visual metaphors, create analysis algorithms, and deliver software products that put useful analytic capabilities into our users’ hands. We draw expertise from across the laboratory – people like statisticians, machine vision experts, modelers, and domain scientists – to work with us to create solutions for our customers’ hardest analysis challenges.

We work with text, image, audio, video, and numerical data, helping people discover patterns, trends, relationships, and events in complex data. And we care about the sensemaking process – how new analytic workflows and reasoning strategies help people make sound decisions from their data.

Our work focuses on five core areas:

- Information Signatures: We create mathematical signatures from text, multimedia, and sensor data, discovering new ways of summarizing key features in large, heterogeneous data sets. We focus on performance and scalability, creating computationally efficient representations of complex data sets.
- Visual Design: We develop new ways to tell stories with data through visual representations. We create aesthetic depictions for complex patterns and relationships that summarize visually the output of our information signatures.
- Analytic Methods: We think a lot about thinking, and we design software and methods that guide our users in exploring and drawing valuable insight from visual representations. We help people use visualizations to create and test hypotheses, communicate results, and challenge assumptions.
- Natural User Interactions: We know that interaction with visual interfaces is where the insight happens. In addition to creating new interactive visual environments for the web, mobile devices, and desktop applications, we explore emerging techniques for gesture and touch interfaces and new display hardware that brings our users closer to their data than ever before.
- User Experience: Underlying all of our work is our ultimate goal: helping people work with information. We bring a user-centered design approach to our work, collaborating closely with users to understand their problems, test solutions, and deliver usable and useful software products.

The IN-SPIRE™ discovery tool integrates information visualization with query and other interactive capabilities. In the Galaxy visualization (upper right), dots represent documents and cluster around center points that represent central topics or themes, like constellations in the sky. The ThemeView™ visualization (lower right) provides an even faster way to get a visual overview of a collection of data. Users see a relief map where the highest peaks represent the most prevalent topics in the collection.

People have the natural ability to rapidly comprehend visual images. To make the most of this skill, researchers at PNNL have developed IN-SPIRE™ and other creative and powerful approaches to present different kinds of data in visual displays.

IN-SPIRE™ can quickly and automatically convey the gist of large sets of unformatted text documents such as technical reports, web data, newswire feeds and message traffic. IN-SPIRE™ can handle real-time data by adding new documents as they arrive. It also processes foreign language data and provides robust support for translation. By clustering similar documents together, this Windows-based software unveils common themes and reveals hidden relationships within the collection. IN-SPIRE™ allows analysts to spend more time exploring the information they find most relevant and less time sifting through the masses of irrelevant documents.

IN-SPIRE™ analyzes a multitude of text files and determines key topics or themes in each to create a signature for each document in the collection. IN-SPIRE's two main visualizations display representations of the documents in which those with similar or related topics appear closer together. The Galaxy visualization uses the metaphor of the stars in the night sky with each star representing an individual document. The ThemeView™ visualization uses a 3-dimensional terrain map display to provide a high-level overview of the data.

Search tools in IN-SPIRE™ support simple queries, phrase queries, and queries with example text. Other tools help to explore trends over time and relationships between concepts. All of the tools in IN-SPIRE™ leverage the power of the Galaxy and ThemeView™ visualizations.

We know that interaction with visual interfaces is where the insight happens.

SYSTEM TENETS

Our tenets are a set of guiding principles that summarize the key elements of the Precision Information Environments user experience. These tenets are informed by end user pain points and offer a collection of metrics the PIE community can use to assess the suitability of its technology.

The Precision Information Environments shall be:

Consistent, intuitive and poignant

The PIE user experience is sensitive to location, device and circumstance, while providing sufficient consistency to make PIE software easy to learn and use. The user experience is intended to be intuitive and the system communicates clearly and compellingly to users.

Comprehensive, accurate and timely

Data and intelligence are continuously gathered, reported and archived real time.   PIEs will supports the collection and sharing of information, and clear representations of uncertainty pervade will information representations throughout the environment. Information visualization will ease information overload and make complex data sources digestible and therefore timely.  Rich simulation and outcome analysis based on accurate information will improve strategic thinking.

Accessible, adaptable and democratized

Within a PIE, information and interfaces are shared across jurisdictions and departments.  The system creates audience-appropriate representations that adapt to different activities and roles.  Situation awareness is ubiquitous across a PIE, and all users have access to clear picture of their roles, responsibilities and options.  Software and information can be used across all phases of operations from first response to advance planning.

Collaborative

Sharing of information, tools, and strategies within a PIE is easy and transparent.  Remote collaboration is seamless and is not limited by location or device constraings.  Teams can work collaboratively in real time and teamwork is enhanced with rich communication and information visualization aids.  The same tools are used for both individual and collaborative productivity.  Social networks are easy to identify and leverage, supported by reputation tracking.  PIEs will supports multiple communication methods seamlessly, enabling users to engage with each other directly.

Built on a sustainable foundation

PIE components are easy to install, maintain and modify.  They will integrate with existing software and will support third-party extension.  PIEs will allow end users to create mashups that integrate diverse data and analysis components.  PIEs will be secure by design, while offering services that are accessible widely across locations and platforms.

Based on these tenets, core PIE capabilities will include:

- Walk-up usability – users can enter the environment and be effectively served in their role without having to spend precious time and effort customizing the system.
- Precise information delivery – information is delivered to fulfill user needs within the context of their current role and types of activities being performed.
- Collaborative analysis and decision making – utilizing the knowledge and experience of peers and the wisdom of the crowd, bring to bear appropriate resources for a given problem or situation.
- Consequence analysis – decision making is improved through an understanding of the consequences of action based on current choices and information available.
- Multi-user, multi-phase operational support – supports multiple levels of users across dimensions of activity (plan, train, respond, recover, and analyze) all on the same system.

Open research

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search

Open research is concerned with making scientific research more transparent, more collaborative and more efficient. A central aspect to it is to provide open access to scientific information, especially to the research published in scholarly journals and to the underlying data, much of which traditional science tends to hide away. Other aspects are more open forms of collaboration and engagement with a wider audience, including citizen scientists and the public at large.

Open research is research conducted in the spirit of free and open source software. Much like open source schemes that are built around a source code that is made public, the central theme of open research is to make clear accounts of the methodology freely available via the internet, along with any data or results extracted or derived from them. This permits a massively distributed collaboration, and one in which anyone may participate at any level of the project.

If the research is scientific in nature, it is frequently referred to as open science.[1][2] Open research can also include social sciences, the humanities, mathematics, engineering and medicine.
…
Unlike open access, true open research must demonstrate live, online collaboration. Project websites that demonstrate this capability have started to become available.[11][12]

In 2005, several examples arose in the area of the search for new/improved medical treatments of Neglected Diseases.[11][13][14][15] [16]

Science and engineering research to support the creation of open source appropriate technology for sustainable development has long used open research principles.[17][18][19][20][21] Open source research for sustainable development is now becoming formalized with open access for literature reviews, research methods, data, results and summaries for laypeople.[22] While first attempts towards opening research were primarily aimed at opening areas such as scientific data, methodologies, software and publications, now increasingly other artifacts of the scientific workflow are also tackled, such as scientific meta-data[23] and funding ideas.[24]

The KeckCAVES provides an intellectual and computational framework for the visual exploration, manipulation, and creation of data and models. We develop and use visualization tools to gain insights into problems that are difficult to address using other techniques.

The growing complexity of scientific data poses serious challenges for an effective visualization. Data sets, e.g., catalogs of objects detected in sky surveys, can have a very high dimensionality, ~ 100 - 1000. Visualizing such hyper-dimensional data parameter spaces is essentially impossible, but there are ways of visualizing up to ~ 10 dimensions in a pseudo-3D display. We have been experimenting with the emerging technologies of immersive virtual reality (VR) as a platform for a scientific, interactive, collaborative data visualization. Our initial experiments used the virtual world of Second Life, and more recently VR worlds based on its open source code, OpenSimulator. There we can visualize up to ~ 100,000 data points in ~ 7 - 8 dimensions (3 spatial and others encoded as shapes, colors, sizes, etc.), in an immersive virtual space where scientists can interact with their data and with each other. We are now developing a more scalable visualization environment using the popular (practically an emerging standard) Unity 3D Game Engine, coded using C#, JavaScript, and the Unity Scripting Language. This visualization tool can be used through a standard web browser, or a standalone browser of its own. Rather than merely plotting data points, the application creates interactive three-dimensional objects of various shapes, colors, and sizes, and of course the XYZ positions, encoding various dimensions of the parameter space, that can be associated interactively. Multiple users can navigate through this data space simultaneously, either with their own, independent vantage points, or with a shared view. At this stage ~ 100,000 data points can be easily visualized within seconds on a simple laptop. The displayed data points can contain linked information; e.g., upon a clicking on a data point, a webpage with additional information can be rendered within the 3D world. A range of functionalities has been already deployed, and more are being added. We expect to make this visualization tool freely available to the academic community within a few months, on an experimental (beta testing) basis.

External Resources to Assist You in Interdisciplinary Research

National Science Foundation

This site is a guide to the different mechanisms through which NSF promotes and supports interdisciplinary research. They provide information on whom to contact for assistance in deciding where and how to submit an interdisciplinary proposal. A primary purpose of this site is to assist investigators in submitting an unsolicited interdisciplinary proposal for which there may not be a natural "home" in one of the existing NSF programs.

National Institutes of Health - Common Fund

The intent of NIH Common Fund programs is to provide a strategic and nimble approach to address key roadblocks in biomedical research that impede basic scientific discovery and its translation into improved human health. In addition, these programs capitalize on emerging opportunities to catalyze the rate of progress across multiple biomedical fields.

The Common Fund’s Interdisciplinary Research (IR) program goal is to change academic research culture such that interdisciplinary approaches and team science spanning various biomedical and behavioral specialties are encouraged and rewarded. The program includes the following components:

- Interdisciplinary Research Consortia

- Interdisciplinary Training Programs

- Innovation in Interdisciplinary Technology and Methods

- Multiple Principal Investigator (Multi-PI) Policy

Collaboration and Team Science

Published in 2010 by the NIH.  The Field Guide was developed to help all researchers navigate some of the rocky and murky territory associated with building a team either on their own or at the request of someone in their organization.

Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary Research

Published June 29, 2012: Jacqueline Resnick (bio) explains the difference between two approaches to research.

The Minefield of Multidisciplinary Work

Published January 9, 2008: Megan R. Gunnar (bio) encourages young researchers to nurture an independent identity while working collaboratively.

Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research

Published 2004, National Academy of Science: Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research examines current interdisciplinary research efforts and recommends ways to stimulate and support such research.

Advances in science and engineering increasingly require the collaboration of scholars from various fields. This shift is driven by the need to address complex problems that cut across traditional disciplines, and the capacity of new technologies to both transform existing disciplines and generate new ones. At the same time, however, interdisciplinary research can be impeded by policies on hiring, promotion, tenure, proposal review, and resource allocation that favor traditional disciplines.

This report identifies steps that researchers, teachers, students, institutions, funding organizations, and disciplinary societies can take to more effectively conduct, facilitate, and evaluate interdisciplinary research programs and projects. Throughout the report key concepts are illustrated with case studies and results of the committee s surveys of individual researchers and university provosts.

Big Enterprise Network Operations Center

The network operations manager is the primary person in the Big Enterprise who works with a team of network operations specialists responsible for the health, security, and performance of the entire network. She explains to you what this responsibility means by providing the following example questions routinely asked:

- Health: Are all the computers behaving as expected with the necessary patches and updates to operate normally?
- Security: Are there any attacks that might affect the Enterprise, such as an active virus, a denial of service, or theft of company secrets?
- Performance: Are there data transfer issues such as routing problems or misconfigurations that are affecting network speed?

As she gives you a tour, you learn a few things about the network itself:

- You verify that the network consists of several hundred thousand computers. The operations manager cannot give an exact number since the branch offices will connect and disconnect computers without coordinating with her.
- The network is connected to the larger Internet, and millions of computers access the company’s computers daily.
- Big Enterprise has a large corporate headquarters with many computers. The headquarters also runs several data centers. Each of these data centers contains thousands of computers. These computers should appear on the network operations manager’s display.

In addition to the corporate headquarters, there are offices all around the world, each of which has its own computers. These computers should also appear on the network operations manager’s display.

Upper management wants your situation awareness visualization to be hosted on a large display to show the state of the entire network. The network operations manager hopes the large situation awareness display will allow her team to get the information she needs from one display instead of several that she deals with now.

She tells you the network operations center is staffed around the clock. In her role as the network operations manager, she and her team must oversee the day-to-day management of the entire corporate network. In addition to responding to routine events, they need to identify and respond to any unusual events occurring across the network. They must continually balance network health, security, and performance issues.

Her main complaints about the current situation awareness display are that the information is often unclear and complicated. The information cues are inconsistent, and important connections between events are often not obvious. She sometimes has to dig into very detailed information to understand something that she thinks could be easily shown up front. She feels that she wastes time digging, and that there has to be a better approach.

Your Mission

Your job is to design a large-scale visualization presenting network activity in such a way that at a glance the network operations manager can effectively and accurately understand what is happening on the network.

Although you would like to ask more questions and get still more background, Big Enterprise executives have politely declined your request. They are looking for a fresh perspective on situation awareness, and do not want to bias your designs by diving into the details of their current approach. The Big Enterprise executives understand that cyber security isn’t necessarily your field. They have said that it is fine if you wish to do some of your own research or talk to people you know who are more familiar with cyber security. Current solutions are inadequate, so Big Enterprise executives emphasize that creativity is key. Instead, they are looking for creative new ideas, possibly borrowed from other fields or using different technologies. They suggested that you remember the following:

- The sky is the limit: they are looking for bigger and bolder ideas than the status quo.
- The bigger the better: represent the biggest network you can.
- The bigger the network, the more stuff happens: represent the greatest amount and diversity of activity you can in the design.
- Managing complexity is essential: balance network scale and network activity with effectiveness of the visual design.

Mapping urban perception among cities and continents

What

Place Pulse quantitatively measures urban perception by crowdsourcing visual surveys to users around the globe.

Why

Cities are not just collections of demographics, but places that people experience. Urban environments are known to elicit strong evaluative responses [1], and there is evidence and theories [2] suggesting that these responses may affect criminal [3] and health [4-5] behaviors. Yet, we lack good quantitative data on the responses elicited by urban environments. Place Pulse is an effort to help collect quantitative data of urban perception to help advance these research efforts and open new avenues of research.

"One thing I have learned in a long life: that all our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike -- and yet it is the most precious thing we have."
-Einstein
http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/philos1.htm

A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving…
http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm

"I am happy because I want nothing from anyone. I do not care for money. Decorations, titles, or distinctions mean nothing to me. I do not crave praise. The only thing that gives me pleasure, apart from my work, my violin, and my sailboat, is the appreciation of my fellow workers."

My political ideal is democracy. Let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized… The really valuable thing in the pageant of human life seems to me not the political state, but the creative, sentient individual, the personality; it alone creates the noble and the sublime, while the herd as such remains dull in thought and dull in feeling.
...This topic brings me to that worst outcrop of herd life, the military system, which I abhor... This plague-spot of civilization ought to be abolished with all possible speed. Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism -- how passionately I hate them!

There are organizations and individuals who are using the principles of Reinventing Fire to make money and gain durable advantage in their industry. We invite you to explore some champions below.

Transportation: Jimmy Yates of Mesilla Valley Transportation

Jimmy Yates of Mesilla Valley Transportation has achieved a significant amount of success with his large locally-owned freight service. What's his secret? In addition to decades of experience maintaining, driving and managing class-8 heavy trucks, he focuses on efficiency. The big rigs in his fleet are sleeker than typical 18-wheelers, with a variety of modifications that help to reduce aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance.

But it's not just the trucks—Jimmy also offers quarterly rewards to the most efficient drivers in his fleet. Each year, the top driver on his team has the chance to win an even bigger prize, such as a '69 Mustang, cash or a Harley Davidson motorcycle. The payoff? His profitable fleet today averages 8.5 MPG—more than the EIA projections point to truck efficiency averaging 7.8 MPG by 2050. Jimmy's fleet is years ahead of the competition.

The innovations found in Jimmy’s fleet are only the beginning of technical, operational and logistical improvements for trucks. Transporting freight, not individuals, uses upwards of 28 percent of the fuel used for overall transportation. Despite an industry whose trucks use very efficient (45+ percent) diesel engines, a majority of that fuel is wasted; but it doesn't need to be this way. With a sharp focus on design and operations, we can reduce large transportation truck diesel fuel consumption by 48 percent by 2050.

Jimmy Yates spends time with each driver in order to train them to accelerate gently, cruise efficienctly and utilize the aid of electronic tool kits that show real-time MPG changes. In addition to this, he employs a 63 mph speed governor in each truck and monitors the performace with an on-board tracking system. The end result of these simple efforts? A 6 percent increase in miles per gallon, one that translates into real savings when you take into account the amount of trucks running and the miles each one covers each day.

Buildings: Malkin Holdings and the Empire State Building

The visionary thinking of Malkin Holdings, owner of the Empire State Building, took a planned capital improvement renovation to a new level by asking a team of experts including Rocky Mountain Institute to recommend sustainability measures that would help them invest intelligently.

Industry: Texas Instruments

Founded in 1951, Texas Instruments (TI) is one of the largest designers and manufacturers of semiconductor products in the world, ranking 223 in the Fortune 500. It has operations globally and each one of its semiconductor plants consume large amounts of energy to manufacture the devices that drive everything from phones to projectors to prosthetics.

Historically, sustainability has not been the core focus at Texas Instruments. Wafer fabs are complex, extremely capital-intensive (often several billion dollars), and highly energy-intensive. Furthermore, reliability is crucial—production stoppages can cost more than $1 million per day. In 2003, when TI was designing plans for a new plant in Richardson, Texas, TI had the courage and the initiative to explore opportunities in energy efficiency. Paul Westbrook, TI’s Sustainability Development Manager, led TI on an effort for major cost reductions as well as a more sustainable fab. These goals, which conventional thinking would say are competing, forced TI to question everything, go back to the drawing board, and innovate.

Using energy-efficient equipment, waste heat energy recovery methods, and innovative designs, TI succeeded in building a unique chip fab which reduced facilities systems energy use by 38 percent and cut natural gas consumption by more than 50 percent. At its completion, the Richardson facility had a capital cost 30 percent less than the previous chip fab (built just 6 miles away), and saved more than $4.0 million per year in operating costs. By building in Texas with innovative fab designs, TI also successfully kept 1,000 high-tech jobs at home and heightened synergies with existing plants.

TI continues to work on multiple sustainability goals, including reductions in resource consumption, waste, and emissions. By 2015, TI anticipates energy and water reductions per chip by an additional 45 percent. Westbrook notes that managing energy is now a part of TI’s DNA—he has employees from all departments calling him up with new ideas. The culture at TI has created an organizational pull for energy management, serving to accelerate progress in sustainability. Thus, though energy constitutes a small part of its total costs, TI serves as a model for other companies that energy management can result in benefits for shareholders, employees, and for society at large.

Electricity: UCSD Microgrid

Local impact, national influence, and global reach. These are the goals that the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) strives for in its academic and research programs. With passionate leaders such as Byron Washom, UCSD’s first director of strategic energy initiatives, UCSD is making good on these aspirations. The University has created an experimental microgrid, which balances and optimizes electricity production, consumption, and storage with state-of-the-art control systems. Dubbed the “living laboratory,” UCSD’s microgrid may become the model for a new utility paradigm of the future.

Foreshadowing the important role that energy management would play at UCSD, the Central Utilities Building was the first structure built after the University’s founding in 1960. Today, UCSD is striving to become a zero-waste campus by 2020, and all new campus buildings are constructed to meet the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design silver or gold standard. Yet, UCSD’s leadership in electricity may have some of the greatest impact on the world. Its experimental microgrid offers a unique combination of software and hardware that takes advantage of advances in information technology (IT) and demand-side technologies and is enabling powerful applications in bidirectional power flow, distributed intelligence and operational control.

The heart of the UCSD energy system is its energy management control system. It controls UCSD’s central cogeneration plant, as well as a set of photovoltaic systems. In addition, the management system is intricately connected to most major loads on campus. With the push of a button, loads can be reduced or shut off completely. Though invisible to the majority of campus residents and visitors, this vital balancing of generation and demand becomes an extremely powerful tool to save costs and drive higher reliability. During emergency events, for instance, a microgrid may disconnect and operate in islanded mode. When the rest of the grid may be threatened with loss of power, UCSD is able to significantly reduce campus demand (by turning down its 4,000 non-critical thermostats by a few imperceptible degrees) and increase on-site generation to maintain its critical operations. When wildfires threatened the local power infrastructure in 2009, for instance, UCSD not only kept its own critical loads on, but it also helped to support the local grid from going down as well.

UCSD’s work with the intermittency of its distributed generation is breaking new ground as well. The output of major renewable energy sources like solar fluctuate with the weather. Integrating these sources into conventional grid operations adds variability and uncertainty to the system. As a result, UCSD’s Associate Professor Jan Kleissl is working with Washom to develop an optimal solar forecasting method to better integrate solar energy into its energy portfolio. If successful, UCSD’s microgrid will serve as a model for future grids that may need to accommodate higher penetrations of solar energy. Moving forward, Washom has plans to incorporate additional electricity storage capabilities as well as electric vehicle charging stations, simulating a new layer of complexity that future grids will have to face.

UCSD is a small component of the grid, but its IT and demand-side solutions may have larger implications for the entire grid. If Washom’s experiment is successful, UCSD’s microgrid may enable a new paradigm of utility operation where microgrids are woven throughout the nation’s electricity system.

The GEWEX global data analysis seeks to obtain observations of the global energy and water cycle with sufficient detail and accuracy to diagnose the causes of recent climate variations in terms of energy and water exchanges among climate components. To enable better analyses and more closely coordinate the production of data products, WGDMA was organized to systematially assess current products, refine and improve analyses with attention to making the long-term record more homogeneous and the products physically consistent, and conduct a complete re-processing of all GEWEX data products.

Science

The more we understand about science and its complexities, the more important it is for scientific data to be shared openly. It’s not useful to have ten different labs doing the same research and not sharing their results; likewise, we’re much more likely to be able to pinpoint diseases if we have genomic data from a large pool of individuals. Since 2004, we’ve been focusing our efforts to expand the use of Creative Commons licenses to scientific and technical research.

- Science Advisory Board

Public Library of Science

In 2003, the Public Library of Science (PLoS) launched a nonprofit scientific and medical publishing venture that provides scientists and physicians with high-quality, high-profile journals in which to publish their most important work. Under the open access model, PLoS journals are immediately available online, with no charges for access and no restrictions on subsequent redistribution or use, as long as the author(s) and source are cited, as specified by the Creative Commons Attribution License.

BioMed Central

BioMed Central is an STM (Science, Technology and Medicine) publisher which has pioneered the open access publishing model, and was acquired by Springer Verlag in 2008. All original research articles published by BioMed Central are made freely and permanently accessible online immediately upon publication. BioMed Central views open access to research as essential in order to ensure the rapid and efficient communication of research findings.

Hindawi

Hindawi Publishing Corporation is a commercial publisher of peer-reviewed journals covering a wide range of academic disciplines. Founded in 1997, Hindawi currently employs more than 300 employees and publishes 200+ open access, peer-reviewed journals. In 2007 Hindawi entered into a publishing partnership with SAGE Publications in order to jointly develop a collection of open access journals, which are hosted on the SAGE-Hindawi platform. Hindawi uses the Creative Commons Attribution License.

Nature Publishing Group

In December 2007, NPG introduced the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike Unported licence for those articles in Nature journals that are publishing the primary sequence of an organism’s genome for the first time. All articles in NPG’s open-access journals Molecular Systems Biology, Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology, and Cell Death and Disease are published under either a Creative Commons attribution-non commercial-share alike unported licence or a non commercial-no derivativess licence. Articles published at Nature Communications under the open access option are published under the same Creative Commons licences as detailed for Molecular Systems Biology.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries

MIT Libraries offers a local version of the Scholar’s Copyright Addendum Engine, created by Creative Commons as a means of simplifying the process of implementing an addendum to retain scholarly rights when publishing.

PLoS Blogs

PLoS Blogs was set up to bring a select group of independent science and medicine bloggers together with the editors and staff who run the independent network made up of writers who love science and medicine, and scientists and physicians that love to write. Here, you’ll find an equal mix of blogs from journalists and researchers tackling diverse issues in science and medicine. All content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

Science 3.0

Science 3.0 combines the hypothesis based inquiry of laboratory science with the methods of social science research to understand and improve the use of new human networks made possible by today’s digital connectivity. This website is a community where those interested in the advancement of research can share ideas, tools and build connections. Content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License unless otherwise stated on blogs.

Personal Genome Project

The Personal Genome Project hopes to make personal genome sequencing more affordable, accessible, and useful for humankind. Volunteers make their full sequence genomes, information about their health, and a line of stem cells derived from their bodies available for all research and commercial purposes. CC0 is used to free the data and health information, and our Materials Transfer Agreements keep the lines of stem cells in the commons.

Open Access

The Scholars’ Copyright Project

Creative Commons plays an instrumental role in the Open Access movement, which is making scholarly research and journals more widely available on the Web. The world’s largest Open Access publishers in the world all use CC licenses to publish their content online.

We’re also expanding Open Access to research institutions. Creative Commons licenses are directly integrated into institutional repository software platforms like DSpace and ePrints. University libraries at MIT, Johns Hopkins, and Carnegie Mellon offer access to our Scholar’s Copyright Addendum Engine, which helps faculty members upload their research for public use while retaining the rights they want to keep.

We’ve created policy briefings and guidelines to help institutions implement Open Access into their frameworks.

Open Data

At Creative Commons, we believe scientific data should be freely available to everyone. We call this idea Open Data. Creative Commons legal tools can be used to make data and databases freely available. We’ve already had successful implementations in taxonomic, energy, genomics, disease research, geospatial, polar, and bilbiometric disciplines, and are providing guidance to funders, institutions, private foundations, governments, the corporate sector, and other stakeholders. Read more about Creative Commons and data.

R&D

The commons doesn’t begin and end with copyrighted works. We think open research materials are vital to innovation, not just data and documents; to that end, we’ve developed and deployed CC-inspired legal tools for transferring biological materials. For example, the Personal Genome Project licensed 1,000 lines of stem cells under CC’s Materials Transfer Agreement, CHDI’s repository of Huntingtons Disease research tools. And we have built a public patent licensing conversation through our involvement in the GreenXchange project.

We have also invested years in researching the realities of re-using open data at web scale through our Neurocommons project, which serves integrated life sciences databases and open-source software essential for re-using data.

Air-Quality Data 3D Visualization

www.cirgeo.unipd.it/nasaww

Show a bird’s-eye 3D view of air-quality data (PM10) acquired at time intervals from multiple sensors to reveal air-quality dynamics over space and time.

Sensors are connected with a Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) to cover the area of interest. Data is represented geometrically and colorized to easily recognize high-to-low values. Areas affected by a potential risk for health are quickly discernible. Users can adjust data-acquisition times for dynamic updating.

Environmental Monitoring With GeoJModelBuilder

www.sourceforge.net/projects/geopw

GeoJModelBuilder couples geo-processing Web services and Sensor Web services to support geo-processing modeling and environmental monitoring. The main goal of GeoJModelBuilder is to bring an easy‑to‑use tool to the geo-scientific community.

The tool allows a user to drag and drop various geospatial services to visually generate workflows and then to interact with those workflows in a virtual globe environment. It also allows users to audit trails of workflow executions, check the provenance of data products and support scientific reproducibility.

Urban Traffic Visual Analytics Simulator

www.interactivesystem.collaborate.org

The goal is to develop a highly interactive visual analytics system that helps urban planners, decision makers and traffic analysts simulate the urban scenario related to the urban viability.  Users interact directly via the 3D context. This ensures intuitive understanding and easy adjustment to any simulated scenario.

The user interacts with the 3D environment through graphical metaphors that considerably reduce the time needed to set the simulation parameters and the time needed to analyze the results.

Real-Time Geospatial Renderer by Gaea+

www.gaeaplus.eu/worldwind-challenge

Extends the World Wind Java core with features crucial for advanced real-time rendering of geospatial information, including optimized Render-to-Texture capabilities enabling visualization of large vector datasets. The GLSL Shader support built directly into the World Wind render-loop makes custom visual effects a breeze, and provides deferred rendering and flexible support for WFS & GML.

This allows us to build mission-critical emergency response systems with massive datasets deployed in several regional call centers, giving spatial planners data visualization and manipulation tools, as well as stunning photo-realistic presentations of our world.

‘Fire highway’ color represents flame height and speed of advance.
Current fire position can be overlaid.

Simulation Tool to Predict Wildfire Behavior

www.emxsys.com

This tool displays the potential movement of wildfire through the terrain via a particle system.

The Wildfire Management Tool (WMT) introduces a new way to analyze and predict wildfire behavior. Instead of a static display, WMT animates the paths that fire will take through the terrain.

A high density or concentration of paths depicts a ‘fire highway.’ As the situation changes, WMT identifies new fire highways as well as areas where fire highways can be intercepted to stop the fire spread. Areas that are ‘slow fire’ paths are good for safe access and present windows of opportunity for control of fast moving fire highways.

Multidimensional Viewer for Large Datasets

http://EuropaChallenge.glob3.org

Multidimensional Viewer allows users to present 3D information from different data sources.

Large datasets of scalar or vector information, coming from point cloud data, can be optimally displayed as 3D information in real time, e.g., LiDAR point clouds, laser scanner point clouds, weather data from High Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM), etc.

Linked Europe Observation Browser

http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/linked-europa-browser/

This is a tool for displaying sensor data in a 3D context that allows better understanding of measured phenomenon. Users can:

·   Display observation data coming from OGC Sensor Observation Service automatically structured as Linked Data following the W3C Semantic Sensor Network Ontology.

·   Simultaneously display up to 3 variables (i.e., wind direction, speed and temperature) coming from a SPARQL Endpoint.

·   Query time periods and display animated results exploring the data.

·   Display links from sensors to the linked data cloud and offers additional information via integrated graph visualization.

PoliCrowd – A Social World Wind Platform

http://geomobile.como.polimi.it/policrowd

PoliCrowd is a 3D participatory application allowing users to populate their geospatial information as represented on the virtual globe.

Registered users can upload Points Of Interest (POIs) through their mobile devices and participatively interact with POIs on the globe, adding textual and multimedia content (e.g., images, audios & videos).

Users can also add WMS layers to populate a catalogue of geographic content useful for scenario customization.  Different projects can also be created, saved and shared to promote community participation.

- An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R by James, Witten, Hastie & Tibshirani – This book is fantastic and has helped me quite a bit. It provides an overview of several methods, along with the R code for how to complete them. 426 Pages.
- The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani & Friedman – This is an in-depth overview of methods, complete with theory, derivations & code. I’d definitely consider this a graduate level text. I’d also consider it one of the best books available on the topic of data mining. 745 Pages.
- A Programmer’s Guide to Data Mining by Ron Zacharski – This one is an online book, each chapter downloadable as a PDF. It’s also still in progress, with chapters being added a few times each year.
- Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers by Cam Davidson-Pilson – This book is absolutely fantastic. The author explains Bayesian statistics, provides several diverse examples of how to apply and includes Python code. Each chapter is an iPython notebook that can be downloaded.
- Think Bayes, Bayesian Statistics Made Simple by Allen B. Downey – Another great, easy to digest introduction to Bayesian statistics. The author’s premise is that Bayesian statistics is easier to learn & apply within the context of reusable code samples. It includes a number of examples complete with Python code. 195 Pages.
- Data Mining and Analysis, Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms by Zaki & Meira – This title is new to me. It’s a text book that looks to be a complete introduction with derivations & plenty of sample problems. 599 Pages.
- An Introduction to Data Science by Jeffrey Stanton – Overview of the skills required to succeed in data science, with a focus on the tools available within R. It has sections on interacting with the Twitter API from within R, text mining, plotting, regression as well as more complicated data mining techniques. 195 Pages.
- Machine Learning by Chebira, Mellouk & others – This is an introduction to more advanced machine learning methods. It includes chapters on neural networks, discriminant analysis, natural language processing, regression trees & more, complete with derivations. Each chapter is downloadable as a PDF. 422 Pages.
- Machine Learning – The Complete Guide – This one is new to me. It’s a collection of Wikipedia articles organized into chapters & downloadable in a number of formats. I didn’t realize they did this, but its a great idea. Because its a collection of individual articles, it covers quite a bit more material than a single author could write. This is an incredible resource.
- Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning by David Barber – This is an undergraduate textbook. It includes an overview, derivations, sample problems and MATLAB code. 648 Pages.
- A Course in Machine Learning by Hal Daumé III – Another complete introduction to machine learning topics. Each chapter is individually downloadable. 189 Pages.
- Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms by David J.C. MacKay – Nice overview of machine learning topics, including an introduction and derivations. One nice feature of this book is that it has a chart that shows how various topics are related to one another. 628 Pages.

I love it that so much material is available for free. All you need is time & motivation and you can be an expert on this topic. If you were to only select one book to pursue from this list, I’d recommend either of the first two.

========================

May 29, 2014: A couple of books have been mentioned in the comments that look noteworthy.

- Modeling with Data by Ben Klemens – Surprisingly, all of the code in this book is C, Klemens includes a section to defend this choice. The book includes plenty of code samples. 454 Pages.
- Mining of Massive Datasets by Rajaraman & Ullman – This book covers concepts and includes several domain specific examples. It includes plenty of derivation and little code. 493 Pages.
